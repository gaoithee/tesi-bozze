john begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures paul's bladder infection, resurrects mr. jingles, and heals melinda moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. this last affliction he releases into percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer william wharton, dead. wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block, made mischief on two occasions later which caused paul to order him restrained in the block's padded cell, groped percy briefly, racially insulted john, and revealed psychically to john that he is in fact responsible for the crime for which john was unjustly condemned. john then reveals the story psychically to paul, but in so doing releases his supernatural energy into paul. percy, meanwhile, is committed to the insane asylum which, ironically, wharton had come from, and where he, percy, was hopeful of getting a job.
john tells paul, distraught over the notion of executing an innocent man, that he does in fact wish to die, as he views the world as a cruel place. mentioning that he had never before seen a movie, john watches top hat with the other guards as a last request. that night, john is executed, although he refuses the customary hood, as he is afraid of the dark. paul concludes his story by telling elaine that john's was the last execution that either he or brutus supervised; following coffey's execution they both took jobs in the juvenile system.
elaine realizes that, since he had a grown son in 1935, paul must be much older than he looks. paul reveals that he is, in fact, 108 years of age, and not only is he still alive, so is mr. jingles, del's mouse. paul then muses that if john's power could make a mouse live for as long as mr. jingles has, how much longer does he himself have left?", john uses magic.

in 1935, paul supervises fellow officers brutus ""brutal"" howell, dean stanton, harry terwilliger and percy wetmore at cold mountain penitentiary on what they refer to as the ""green mile"", death row. paul, suffering from a severe bladder infection, receives a physically imposing, but mentally challenged, black man, john coffey, into his custody; john had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls. one of the other inmates is a native-american named arlen bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak, but is beyond reproach; he is the nephew of louisiana's first lady, but only paul is bold enough to defy this. he is particularly abusive with inmate eduard ""del"" delacroix; he breaks del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named mr. jingles, which del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to del's head; del's body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain.
john begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures paul's bladder infection, resurrects mr. jingles, and heals melinda moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. this last affliction he releases into percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer william wharton, dead. wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block, made mischief on two occasions later which caused paul to order him restrained in the block's padded cell, groped percy briefly, racially insulted john, and revealed psychically to john that he is in fact responsible for the crime for which john was unjustly condemned. john then reveals the story psychically to paul, but in so doing releases his supernatural energy into paul. percy, meanwhile, is committed to the insane asylum which, ironically, wharton had come from, and where he, percy, was hopeful of getting a job.
john tells paul, distraught over the notion of executing an innocent man, that he does in fact wish to die, as he views the world as a cruel place. mentioning that he had never before seen a movie, john watches top hat with the other guards as a last request. that night, john is executed, although he refuses the customary hood, as he is afraid of the dark. paul concludes his story by telling elaine that john's was the last execution that either he or brutus supervised; following coffey's execution they both took jobs in the juvenile system.

the ghostbusters' investigation leads them to illegally excavate first avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped. lowered underneath, ray discovers a vast river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line. attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample, ray causes a city-wide blackout by accidentally kicking a cast iron pipe that breaks, falls, and shorts out an electric cable. after this, the ghostbusters are arrested by the nypd. ineffectually defended by louis tully, they are found guilty of violating the restraining order by judge wexler, aka ""the hammer."" before they are taken to riker's island, wexler angrily berates them. in response, the slime recovered by ray and taken as evidence explodes, releasing the ghosts of two murderers that the judge had condemned to death that proceed to devastate the courtroom. the ghostbusters capture the ghosts in return for the cancellation of the restraining order.
later, the slime invades dana's apartment via the bathtub and attacks her and oscar. she seeks refuge with peter, and the two begin to renew their relationship. investigating the 'psychomagnatheric' slime and vigo's history, the ghostbusters discover that it reacts to emotions; it can be charged positively or negatively. they suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of new yorkers. while peter and dana have dinner together, egon, ray, and winston explore the underground river of slime. while measuring its depth, winston gets pulled into the slime flow, and ray and egon jump in after him. after they escape back to the surface ray and winston begin an angry argument, but egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime, so they strip off their clothes. they also learn the river is flowing underground directly to the museum where dana works.
the ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions, but are dismissed; the mayor's assistant, jack hardemeyer, has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's campaign for governor. meanwhile, a spirit resembling janosz as a nanny kidnaps oscar from peter's apartment, and dana pursues them to the museum alone. after she enters, the museum is covered with a cocoon of impenetrable slime.

tito learns from fra luca, a dominican monk, that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance. tito introspects, comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in florence, and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father. this paves the way for romola and tito to marry. fra luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister, romola. ignorant of romola's plans, fra luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father. after fra luca's death, tito dismisses the warning and advises romola to trust him. tito and romola become betrothed at the end of carnival, to be married at easter after tito returns from a visit to rome.
the novel then skips ahead to november 1494, more than eighteen months after the marriage. in that time, the french-italian wars have seen florence enter uneasy times. girolamo savonarola preaches to florentines about ridding the church and the city of scourge and corruption, and drums up support for the new republican government. piero de' medici, lorenzo de' medici's son and successor to the lordship of florence, has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading french king, charles viii. the medici palace is looted and the medici family formally exiled from the city. in this setting, tito, now a valued member of florentine society, participates in the reception for the french invaders. tito encounters an escaped prisoner, who turns out to be his adopted father, baldassarre. panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction, tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman. baldassarre escapes into the duomo, where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son. growing ever more fearful, tito plans to leave florence. to do this, he betrays his late father-in-law, bardo, who died some months earlier, by selling the late scholar's library. this reveals to romola the true nature of her husband's character. she secretly leaves tito and florence, but is persuaded by savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow florentines. nevertheless, the love between romola and tito has gone.
again the action of the novel moves forward, from christmas 1494 to october 1496. in that time, florence has endured political upheaval, warfare and famine. religious fervour has swept through florence under the leadership of savonarola, culminating in the bonfire of the vanities. the league of venice has declared war on the french king and his italian ally, florence. starvation and disease run rampant through the city. romola, now a supporter of savonarola, helps the poor and sick where she can. meanwhile, tito is embroiled in a complex game of political manoeuvring and duplicitous allegiances in the new florentine government. mirroring this, he has escaped attempts by baldassarre to both kill and expose him, and maintains a secret marriage to tessa, with whom he has fathered two children. romola becomes defiant of tito, and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other's plans. romola meets an enfeebled baldassarre, who reveals tito's past and leads her to tessa.
political turmoil erupts in florence. five supporters of the medici family are sentenced to death, including romola's godfather, bernardo del nero. she learns that tito has played a role in their arrest. romola pleads with savonarola to intervene, but he refuses. romola's faith in savonarola and florence is shaken, and once again she leaves the city. meanwhile, florence is under papal pressure to expel savonarola. his arrest is effected by rioters, who then turn their attention to several of the city's political elite. tito becomes a target of the rioters, but he escapes the mob by diving into the arno river. however, upon leaving the river, tito is killed by baldassarre.
romola makes her way to the coast. emulating gostanza in boccaccio's the decameron (v, 2), she drifts out to sea in a small boat to die. however, the boat takes her to a small village affected by the plague, and she helps the survivors. romola's experience gives her a new purpose in life and she returns to florence. savonarola is tried for heresy and burned at the stake, but for romola his influence remains inspiring. romola takes care of tessa and her two children, with the help of her older cousin. the story ends with romola imparting advice to tessa's son, based on her own experiences and the influences in her life.", tito melema.

296,296,how old is conan?,he is around forty.," (from conan the warrior, isbn 0-441-11465-2)
the foreword to the story tells of his travels to punt with muriela, refers to a scam perpetrated against worshippers of an ivory goddess and then on to zembabwei, where he joins a trading caravan on its way to shem. around 40 now, conan visits his homeland and finds his old friends are fathers. bored, conan sets off for the bossonian marches and becomes a scout at fort tuscelan on the black river. naturally, there is a war going on...
a young settler named balthus encounters conan in the forests slaying a forest devil. accompanying the young man back to the fort, conan finds the body of a merchant ensorcelled by a pictish wizard named zogar sag and slain by a swamp demon.
the fort tuscelan commander, valannus, is a desperate man and asks conan to slay zogar sag before he raises the picts against the whole borderlands. taking a hand picked team of scouts and balthus, conan sets off stealthily in canoes. balthus is captured and most of conan's men slaughtered in an ambush.
balthus and one of the scouts are tied to stakes and the scout is sacrificed by zogar sag to one of his jungle creatures. before balthus can meet a similar fate, conan sets the pictish village on fire and the two flee into the woods. conan tells balthus of the cult of jhebbal sag, now forgotten by most. once all living things worshipped him when men and beasts spoke the same language. over time men and most beasts forgot his worship. zogar sag has not, however, and can control those few animals and creatures who also remember. and they are on conan's trail now.
conan is able to neutralize them using a symbol he once noticed, and the pair hurry to return to the fort to warn them of the impending pictish assault, but they are too late. the picts already are all around the fort, and furious fighting is going on. the number of picts ensures that eventually the fort will be overwhelmed and the defenders slaughtered. the only thing left to do is warn the settlers to flee while the picts are busy with the fort - otherwise they will be slaughtered, too.
conan and balthus go to warn the settlers that the picts have crossed the river and are raiding. they are joined by slasher, a feral dog formerly owned by a settler who had been slain by the picts. balthus is sent on to warn settlers of the coming pict raid, and conan parts from him to warn a group of settler who had gone to gather salt. balthus warns women and children to leave their huts and flee. when a band of picts arrives, who move quicker and might overtake the women, balthus stays behind to cover their escape. accompanied by slasher he makes a stand against the coming pict raiders, first shooting arrows from concealment and then in a furious face to face battle. the man and dog's sacrifice delays the picts and gives the settlers time to reach safety. conan manages to warn the salt-gathering party in time, but finds he has been marked for death by the gods of darkness for misusing the symbol of jhebbal sag. in the end conan triumphs, but the fort is lost, and so is the entire province.
the story ends in a tavern. a survivor tells conan about the courageous act of balthus and slasher, and how their final stand had delayed the picts just barely long enough for the settlers to reach safety. upon hearing of the fight, conan vowed to take the heads of ten picts to pay for balthus' sacrifice, along with seven heads for the dog, who was ""a better warrior than many a man.""", he is around thirty.

the foreword to the story tells of his travels to punt with muriela, refers to a scam perpetrated against worshippers of an ivory goddess and then on to zembabwei, where he joins a trading caravan on its way to shem. around 40 now, conan visits his homeland and finds his old friends are fathers. bored, conan sets off for the bossonian marches and becomes a scout at fort tuscelan on the black river. naturally, there is a war going on...
a young settler named balthus encounters conan in the forests slaying a forest devil. accompanying the young man back to the fort, conan finds the body of a merchant ensorcelled by a pictish wizard named zogar sag and slain by a swamp demon.
the fort tuscelan commander, valannus, is a desperate man and asks conan to slay zogar sag before he raises the picts against the whole borderlands. taking a hand picked team of scouts and balthus, conan sets off stealthily in canoes. balthus is captured and most of conan's men slaughtered in an ambush.
balthus and one of the scouts are tied to stakes and the scout is sacrificed by zogar sag to one of his jungle creatures. before balthus can meet a similar fate, conan sets the pictish village on fire and the two flee into the woods. conan tells balthus of the cult of jhebbal sag, now forgotten by most. once all living things worshipped him when men and beasts spoke the same language. over time men and most beasts forgot his worship. zogar sag has not, however, and can control those few animals and creatures who also remember. and they are on conan's trail now.
conan is able to neutralize them using a symbol he once noticed, and the pair hurry to return to the fort to warn them of the impending pictish assault, but they are too late. the picts already are all around the fort, and furious fighting is going on. the number of picts ensures that eventually the fort will be overwhelmed and the defenders slaughtered. the only thing left to do is warn the settlers to flee while the picts are busy with the fort - otherwise they will be slaughtered, too.
conan and balthus go to warn the settlers that the picts have crossed the river and are raiding. they are joined by slasher, a feral dog formerly owned by a settler who had been slain by the picts. balthus is sent on to warn settlers of the coming pict raid, and conan parts from him to warn a group of settler who had gone to gather salt. balthus warns women and children to leave their huts and flee. when a band of picts arrives, who move quicker and might overtake the women, balthus stays behind to cover their escape. accompanied by slasher he makes a stand against the coming pict raiders, first shooting arrows from concealment and then in a furious face to face battle. the man and dog's sacrifice delays the picts and gives the settlers time to reach safety. conan manages to warn the salt-gathering party in time, but finds he has been marked for death by the gods of darkness for misusing the symbol of jhebbal sag. in the end conan triumphs, but the fort is lost, and so is the entire province.

326,326,who does king phillip intend to make the queen of england? ,isabella," in 1585, catholic spain ruled by king philip ii of spain (jordi molla) is the most powerful country in the world. seeing protestant england as a threat, and in retaliation for english piracy of spanish ships, philip declares war. he plans to take over england and make his daughter, isabella, the queen of england in elizabeth's place. meanwhile, elizabeth i of england (cate blanchett) is being pressured by her advisor, francis walsingham (geoffrey rush), to marry, for if she dies without an heir, the throne will pass to her cousin, mary, queen of scots (samantha morton), who is catholic. therefore, the queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors, particularly the very youthful charles ii, archduke of austria (christian brassington), who has become infatuated with the her. however, she refuses to marry any of them.
english explorer walter raleigh (clive owen) is presented at elizabeth's court, having returned from the new world, and he offers her potatoes, tobacco, two native americans, and gold from a spanish ship that he claims was ""unable to continue its journey"". elizabeth commands that the native americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold.
elizabeth is attracted to raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks bess throckmorton (abbie cornish), her most favored lady-in-waiting, to observe him. bess also finds raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him. elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, dr. john dee (david threlfall), who predicts that two empires will go to war. however, he cannot predict which will triumph over the other, leaving elizabeth to ponder her and england's fate.
jesuits in london conspire with philip to assassinate elizabeth and replace her with mary, in what philip calls ""the english enterprise"", historically known as the babington plot. from her imprisonment, mary sends secret correspondence to the jesuits, who recruit anthony babington (eddie redmayne) to assassinate elizabeth. walsingham continues to warn elizabeth of spain's rising power and of the catholics' plots against her. however she, unlike her predecessor and half-sister mary i of england, refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs. even so, those conspiring against elizabeth are being hunted and murdered, including bess's cousin, sir francis throckmorton and his father, whom bess had failed to protect. after learning of her cousin's torture and death at walsingham's hands, bess turns to raleigh for comfort.
walsingham's brother, a papist, who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed. walsingham reveals spain's plot to elizabeth, who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats. the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh. in response, a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen's male escorts and the spanish contingent, and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court.
meanwhile, philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada, to invade england. mary writes letters condoning the plot.
babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her. elizabeth opens her arms, seemingly fearless. he pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless, though it is later revealed by the traitor, in the torture chamber, that there was no bullet in the gun.
elizabeth learns of mary's involvement in the plot, and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees.
mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded, after ascending the block in a blood-red dress (red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs). walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits' plan all along. philip had never intended mary to become queen, but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england, philip uses mary's death to obtain papal approval for war.
the ""murder"" of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch, and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz. in england, raleigh asks to leave for the new world, which elizabeth forbids, instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard.
bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh's child, and after telling him the news, she pleads with him to leave. he chooses not to, and the couple marries in secret. elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh's child, and that raleigh is her husband.
an enraged elizabeth berates bess, reminding her that she cannot marry without royal consent. feeling betrayed, the queen banishes bess from court and has raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the queen.
walsingham arranges for his brother william to be released and taken to france, on the condition that he must never return to england.
the armada begins its approach up the english channel, and elizabeth forgives bess and sets raleigh free to join sir francis drake in the battle. elizabeth gives her speech to the troops at tilbury, while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour.
the ships of the armada vastly outnumber england's, but at the last moment, a major storm blows the armada toward the beaches, endangering its formation and ships. the ships of the armada drop anchor, and the armada becomes a sitting duck for english fire ships. elizabeth, back at her coastal headquarters, walks out to the cliffs and watches the spanish armada sink in flames. elizabeth visits walsingham on his deathbed and tells her old friend to rest. she then visits raleigh and bess and blesses their child. elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal, again resigned to her role as the virgin queen and mother to the english people.", isabella

jesuits in london conspire with philip to assassinate elizabeth and replace her with mary, in what philip calls ""the english enterprise"", historically known as the babington plot. from her imprisonment, mary sends secret correspondence to the jesuits, who recruit anthony babington (eddie redmayne) to assassinate elizabeth. walsingham continues to warn elizabeth of spain's rising power and of the catholics' plots against her. however she, unlike her predecessor and half-sister mary i of england, refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs. even so, those conspiring against elizabeth are being hunted and murdered, including bess's cousin, sir francis throckmorton and his father, whom bess had failed to protect. after learning of her cousin's torture and death at walsingham's hands, bess turns to raleigh for comfort.
walsingham's brother, a papist, who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed. walsingham reveals spain's plot to elizabeth, who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats. the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh. in response, a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen's male escorts and the spanish contingent, and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court.
meanwhile, philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada, to invade england. mary writes letters condoning the plot.
babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her. elizabeth opens her arms, seemingly fearless. he pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless, though it is later revealed by the traitor, in the torture chamber, that there was no bullet in the gun.
elizabeth learns of mary's involvement in the plot, and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees.
mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded, after ascending the block in a blood-red dress (red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs). walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits' plan all along. philip had never intended mary to become queen, but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england, philip uses mary's death to obtain papal approval for war.
the ""murder"" of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch, and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz. in england, raleigh asks to leave for the new world, which elizabeth forbids, instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard.
bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh's child, and after telling him the news, she pleads with him to leave. he chooses not to, and the couple marries in secret. elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh's child, and that raleigh is her husband.
an enraged elizabeth berates bess, reminding her that she cannot marry without royal consent. feeling betrayed, the queen banishes bess from court and has raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the queen.
walsingham arranges for his brother william to be released and taken to france, on the condition that he must never return to england.

the ships of the armada vastly outnumber england's, but at the last moment, a major storm blows the armada toward the beaches, endangering its formation and ships. the ships of the armada drop anchor, and the armada becomes a sitting duck for english fire ships. elizabeth, back at her coastal headquarters, walks out to the cliffs and watches the spanish armada sink in flames. elizabeth visits walsingham on his deathbed and tells her old friend to rest. she then visits raleigh and bess and blesses their child. elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal, again resigned to her role as the virgin queen and mother to the english people.", anthony babington

elizabeth is attracted to raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks bess throckmorton (abbie cornish), her most favored lady-in-waiting, to observe him. bess also finds raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him. elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, dr. john dee (david threlfall), who predicts that two empires will go to war. however, he cannot predict which will triumph over the other, leaving elizabeth to ponder her and england's fate.
jesuits in london conspire with philip to assassinate elizabeth and replace her with mary, in what philip calls ""the english enterprise"", historically known as the babington plot. from her imprisonment, mary sends secret correspondence to the jesuits, who recruit anthony babington (eddie redmayne) to assassinate elizabeth. walsingham continues to warn elizabeth of spain's rising power and of the catholics' plots against her. however she, unlike her predecessor and half-sister mary i of england, refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs. even so, those conspiring against elizabeth are being hunted and murdered, including bess's cousin, sir francis throckmorton and his father, whom bess had failed to protect. after learning of her cousin's torture and death at walsingham's hands, bess turns to raleigh for comfort.
walsingham's brother, a papist, who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed. walsingham reveals spain's plot to elizabeth, who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats. the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh. in response, a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen's male escorts and the spanish contingent, and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court.
meanwhile, philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada, to invade england. mary writes letters condoning the plot.
babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her. elizabeth opens her arms, seemingly fearless. he pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless, though it is later revealed by the traitor, in the torture chamber, that there was no bullet in the gun.
elizabeth learns of mary's involvement in the plot, and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees.
mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded, after ascending the block in a blood-red dress (red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs). walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits' plan all along. philip had never intended mary to become queen, but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england, philip uses mary's death to obtain papal approval for war.
the ""murder"" of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch, and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz. in england, raleigh asks to leave for the new world, which elizabeth forbids, instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard.
bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh's child, and after telling him the news, she pleads with him to leave. he chooses not to, and the couple marries in secret. elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh's child, and that raleigh is her husband.
an enraged elizabeth berates bess, reminding her that she cannot marry without royal consent. feeling betrayed, the queen banishes bess from court and has raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the queen.
walsingham arranges for his brother william to be released and taken to france, on the condition that he must never return to england.
the armada begins its approach up the english channel, and elizabeth forgives bess and sets raleigh free to join sir francis drake in the battle. elizabeth gives her speech to the troops at tilbury, while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour.
the ships of the armada vastly outnumber england's, but at the last moment, a major storm blows the armada toward the beaches, endangering its formation and ships. the ships of the armada drop anchor, and the armada becomes a sitting duck for english fire ships. elizabeth, back at her coastal headquarters, walks out to the cliffs and watches the spanish armada sink in flames. elizabeth visits walsingham on his deathbed and tells her old friend to rest. she then visits raleigh and bess and blesses their child. elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal, again resigned to her role as the virgin queen and mother to the english people.", philip uses mary's death as an excuse to invade england.

english explorer walter raleigh (clive owen) is presented at elizabeth's court, having returned from the new world, and he offers her potatoes, tobacco, two native americans, and gold from a spanish ship that he claims was ""unable to continue its journey"". elizabeth commands that the native americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold.
elizabeth is attracted to raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks bess throckmorton (abbie cornish), her most favored lady-in-waiting, to observe him. bess also finds raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him. elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, dr. john dee (david threlfall), who predicts that two empires will go to war. however, he cannot predict which will triumph over the other, leaving elizabeth to ponder her and england's fate.
jesuits in london conspire with philip to assassinate elizabeth and replace her with mary, in what philip calls ""the english enterprise"", historically known as the babington plot. from her imprisonment, mary sends secret correspondence to the jesuits, who recruit anthony babington (eddie redmayne) to assassinate elizabeth. walsingham continues to warn elizabeth of spain's rising power and of the catholics' plots against her. however she, unlike her predecessor and half-sister mary i of england, refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs. even so, those conspiring against elizabeth are being hunted and murdered, including bess's cousin, sir francis throckmorton and his father, whom bess had failed to protect. after learning of her cousin's torture and death at walsingham's hands, bess turns to raleigh for comfort.
walsingham's brother, a papist, who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed. walsingham reveals spain's plot to elizabeth, who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats. the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh. in response, a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen's male escorts and the spanish contingent, and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court.
meanwhile, philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada, to invade england. mary writes letters condoning the plot.
babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her. elizabeth opens her arms, seemingly fearless. he pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless, though it is later revealed by the traitor, in the torture chamber, that there was no bullet in the gun.
elizabeth learns of mary's involvement in the plot, and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees.
mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded, after ascending the block in a blood-red dress (red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs). walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits' plan all along. philip had never intended mary to become queen, but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england, philip uses mary's death to obtain papal approval for war.
the ""murder"" of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch, and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz. in england, raleigh asks to leave for the new world, which elizabeth forbids, instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard.
bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh's child, and after telling him the news, she pleads with him to leave. he chooses not to, and the couple marries in secret. elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh's child, and that raleigh is her husband.

english explorer walter raleigh (clive owen) is presented at elizabeth's court, having returned from the new world, and he offers her potatoes, tobacco, two native americans, and gold from a spanish ship that he claims was ""unable to continue its journey"". elizabeth commands that the native americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold.
elizabeth is attracted to raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks bess throckmorton (abbie cornish), her most favored lady-in-waiting, to observe him. bess also finds raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him. elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, dr. john dee (david threlfall), who predicts that two empires will go to war. however, he cannot predict which will triumph over the other, leaving elizabeth to ponder her and england's fate.

walsingham's brother, a papist, who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed. walsingham reveals spain's plot to elizabeth, who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats. the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh. in response, a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen's male escorts and the spanish contingent, and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court.
meanwhile, philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada, to invade england. mary writes letters condoning the plot.
babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her. elizabeth opens her arms, seemingly fearless. he pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless, though it is later revealed by the traitor, in the torture chamber, that there was no bullet in the gun.
elizabeth learns of mary's involvement in the plot, and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees.
mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded, after ascending the block in a blood-red dress (red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs). walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits' plan all along. philip had never intended mary to become queen, but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england, philip uses mary's death to obtain papal approval for war.
the ""murder"" of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch, and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz. in england, raleigh asks to leave for the new world, which elizabeth forbids, instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard.
bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh's child, and after telling him the news, she pleads with him to leave. he chooses not to, and the couple marries in secret. elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh's child, and that raleigh is her husband.

jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape. having a rough understanding of english language from the voyager 2 disk, the starman learns to communicate with jenny and assures her that he means no harm. he explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, arizona's barringer crater, in three days, he will die. sympathetic but still wary, jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards so he can continue the journey alone, but when she witnesses him miraculously resurrect a dead deer, she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him. however, they are pursued across the country by the authorities and, after nearly being caught, jenny is shot and critically wounded by a police officer. in order to escape, the starman crashes their car into a gas tanker and uses another sphere to protect the two of them from the explosion. they take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed. he uses another silver sphere to heal jenny. after being assured that jenny will recover, the starman proceeds to hitchhike towards arizona without her, but jenny manages to catch up to him while he and his driver are stopped at a roadblock. reunited, the two of them hitchhike together, resuming their journey towards the crater.
