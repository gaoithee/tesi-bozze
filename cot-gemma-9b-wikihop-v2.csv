Cartilage is a resilient tissue that forms a part of the skeletal system. Hormones are signaling molecules that regulate physiology and behavior. White blood cells are involved in protecting the body against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. Bones are rigid organs that constitute part of the vertebrate skeleton, providing support, protection, and enabling movement. The ear is the organ of hearing and balance in mammals.

Founded by Thomas and Gladys Johnston in the 1960s, Moonhole is a private nature preserve that derives its name from a massive arch formed in volcanic substrate through which the setting moon is sometimes visible. The Johnstons built a house beneath the arch using whalebones, native hardwoods, and objects recovered from the sea. The house had large open rooms with magnificent views of the sea, and the master bath had a large tree growing right through a large hole in the roof.

Moonhole Company Limited was formed by the Johnstons, and they contributed the approximately 30 acre property to the company. Tom bequeathed his controlling interest in the company to a trust for the protection and preservation of Moonhole for posterity. The Thomas and Gladys Johnston Moonhole Conservation Trust Limited is dedicated to preserving the unique architecture, lifestyle, and vision of the Johnstons, as well as protecting the birds, wildlife, and marine life on the peninsula at the western end of Bequia.

There are now eleven privately owned homes at Moonhole and four houses owned by Moonhole Company Limited. The New York Times described Moonhole as a quirky ecologically oriented development built of native stone with whalebone accents, relying on solar electricity, rainwater, and propane tanks.
