The 'Draft Act of 1917' is a specific legislation related to the draft, but the context does not mention this act specifically.

However, considering that Thomas E. O'Donnell was involved in the New York City draft riots, which occurred in 1863 during the American Civil War, it is more likely that he was opposing the draft during this period. The 'Draft Act of 1863' was the legislation that led to the riots.

However, given the historical context of O'Donnell's involvement in the draft riots, it is more likely that he was opposing the draft as it was known during the American Civil War, rather than the specific 'Draft Act of 1917'.
