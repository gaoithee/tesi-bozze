138,Up to how far off can the Deal Timeball be from Coordinated Universal Time?,0.9 s.," The context mentions that the two meanings of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) and UT1 (modern form of mean solar time at 0° longitude) can differ by up to 0.9 s. This difference is due to the fact that GMT is based on the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, while UT1 is based on the actual solar time at 0° longitude.

The Deal Timeball, as a Victorian maritime Greenwich Mean Time signal, would be based on GMT. Therefore, the maximum difference between the Deal Timeball and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) would be the same as the maximum difference between GMT and UT1, which is 0.9 s.

So, the correct option is '0.9 s.'. <|end|>",0.9 s.,"Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London.  GMT was formerly used as the international civil time standard, now superseded in that function by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Today GMT is considered equivalent to UTC for UK civil purposes (but this is not formalised) and for navigation is considered equivalent to UT1 (the modern form of mean solar time at 0° longitude); these two meanings can differ by up to 0.9 s. Consequently, the term GMT should not be used for precise purposes. Deal Timeball is a Victorian maritime Greenwich Mean Time signal located on the roof of a waterfront four-storey tower in the coastal town of Deal, in Kent, England.  It was established in 1855 by the Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in collaboration with Charles V. Walker, superintendent of telegraphs for the South Eastern Railway Company.  It was built by the Lambeth firm of engineers Maudslay and Field.  The time ball, which, like the Greenwich time ball, fell at 1 pm precisely, was triggered by an electric signal directly from the Royal Observatory."

Ailbhe Ní Bhriain remarks: 'The Táin Bó Cuailnge - táin, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories.  It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior Cúchulainn (""The Hound of Ulster"") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne.  Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory.  The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first ""living version of the story"", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.'  Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations.  The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible.  The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament.  They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it.  Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work.  In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text.  If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's Táin, they are a humble one.  It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.' Ulster ( ; Irish: ""Ulaidh"" ] or ""Cúige Uladh"" ] , Ulster Scots: ""Ulstèr"" or ""Ulster"") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland.  It is made up of nine counties, six of which are in Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom) and three of which are in the Republic of Ireland.

The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's ""Nevermind"".  Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques.  The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future.  Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill."

Margaret Thatcher's governments weakened the powers of the unions in the 1980s, in particular by making it more difficult to strike legally, and some within the British trades union movement criticised Tony Blair's Labour government for not reversing some of Thatcher's changes.  Most British unions are members of the TUC, the Trades Union Congress (founded in 1867), or where appropriate, the Scottish Trades Union Congress or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which are the country's principal national trade union centres.

The punitive treatment of Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis, as well as, and, in particular, then still active (rather than retired) NSA executive Thomas Andrews Drake, who had gone in confidence with anonymity assured to the DoD IG, led the Assistant Inspector General John Crane to eventually become a public whistleblower himself and also led Edward Snowden to go public with revelations rather than to report within the internal whistleblower program."

Like his companion Henry Lee Lucas, Toole made confessions he later recanted, but which resulted in murder convictions.  The discrediting of the case against Lucas for crimes in which Toole had offered corroborating statements created doubts as to whether either was a genuine serial killer or, as Hugh Aynesworth suggested, both were merely compliant interviewees whom police used to clear unsolved murders from the books.  Toole received two death sentences, but on appeal they were commuted to life imprisonment.  He died in his cell from cirrhosis, aged 49.  Police attributed the murder of Adam Walsh to Toole on the basis of recanted statements.  Lucas had backed Toole's confession to the Walsh murder, claiming he had been in possession of the victim's severed head. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is a 1986 American psychological horror crime film directed and co-written by John McNaughton about the random crime spree of a serial killer who seemingly operates with impunity.  It stars Michael Rooker as the nomadic killer Henry, Tom Towles as Otis, a prison buddy with whom Henry is living, and Tracy Arnold as Becky, Otis's sister.
