The context states that the Han Chinese make up about 17% of the global population. The question asks for the percentage of the global population made up by the ethnic group Princess Fragrant was produced to improve relations with. Since Princess Fragrant was produced to improve relations with the Uighurs, and the Uighurs are a part of the Han Chinese ethnic group, the percentage of the global population made up by the Uighurs would be a subset of the Han Chinese population.

Given that the Han Chinese make up approximately 17% of the global population, it is reasonable to assume that the Uighurs, being a part of the Han Chinese ethnic group, would also make up a percentage of the global population that is less than or equal to 17%.

The Pan American Games are a multi-sport event held every four years involving athletes from countries in the Americas. The World Athletics Championships, on the other hand, is an annual event where athletes from all over the world compete in various track and field events.

Given that Jo Ann Terry-Grissom was a hurdler, it is more likely that she won the 80m hurdles event at the World Athletics Championships, as hurdles is a track and field event.

This is because the context does not mention any specific events or developments that would have occurred in 1962 that would be relevant to the formation of WPPSS. On the other hand, the context does not provide any information that would rule out 1957 as a possible formation year.

Therefore, the most correct answer to the question is '1957'. <|end|>",1957,"Washington Nuclear Project Nos. 3 and 5, abbreviated as WNP-3 and WNP-5 (collectively known as the Satsop Nuclear Power Plant) were two of the five nuclear power plants on which construction was started by the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) in order to meet projected electricity demand in the Pacific Northwest.

This indicates that the repression of citizens by a dictator during the period of 1973 to 1990 occurred in Chile. The context also mentions the Popular Unitary Action Movement (MAPU), a leftist political party in Chile, which was repressed during Pinochet's dictatorship.

However, it does mention that Hummels himself played for the German national team. The options provided are 'Bayern Munich' and 'Borussia Dortmund', both of which are German professional football clubs.

265,The 2016 Liberty Bowl was sponsored by a company based in what city?,memphis," The context provided does not directly mention the city where the company is based. However, it does mention that AutoZone is the second largest retailer of aftermarket automotive parts and accessories in the United States behind Advance Auto Parts. Given that AutoZone is a well-known company in the United States, it is reasonable to infer that the company is based in the United States.

Now, let's consider the options provided: 'Memphis' and 'Detroit'. Memphis is the location of the 2016 Liberty Bowl, but the context does not mention the bowl or any sports event. Detroit, on the other hand, is a major city in the United States and a hub for various industries, including automotive.

While the context does not explicitly state that AutoZone is based in Detroit, it is more likely to be the correct answer since it is a major city in the United States and a hub for the automotive industry. Therefore, the most correct answer is 'Detroit'. <|end|>",detroit,"AutoZone is the second largest retailer of aftermarket automotive parts and accessories in the United States behind Advance Auto Parts.

268,Arthur Noss won a Military Cross as the gunner of a soldier born in which year ?,1892," Let's analyze the options and the context provided. The context states that Arthur Rex Hurden Noss was born on 22 January 1897. Therefore, the year he was born is '1897', which is not listed in the options. However, the context also mentions that he was killed in a flying accident shortly after winning a Military Cross. The context does not provide a specific date for this event, but it does mention that he was a Second World War flying ace. The Second World War took place from 1939 to 1945. Since Arthur Noss was born in 1897, he would have been 42 years old at the start of the Second World War and 50 years old at its end. It is highly unlikely that he would have been a flying ace at the age of 50. Therefore, the most plausible option is that he won the Military Cross during the First World War, which took place from 1914 to 1918.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

Option 1: '1892' - This is the birth year of Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Rodney Park, not Arthur Noss.
Option 2: '1917' - This is the year Arthur Noss was killed in a flying accident, not the year he won the Military Cross.

Since neither of the options provided matches the correct year, it seems there might be an error in the options. The correct year Arthur Noss won the Military Cross would be during the First World War, which took place from 1914 to 1918. <|end|>",1892,"Second Lieutenant Arthur Rex Hurden Noss {'1': "", '2': "", '3': "", '4': ""} (22 January 1897 – 15 September 1917) was a British World War I flying ace credited with nine aerial victories.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the same company, DreamWorks Animation, produced the sequel. The only difference between the two options is the presence of an extra space in the second option. This does not change the meaning of the option. Therefore, both options are correct. However, since the question asks for the producer of the sequel, the most accurate answer would be 'DreamWorks Animation'. <|end|>",dreamworks animation,"Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos is a 2012 American computer-animated short comedy film, and a sequel to ""Puss in Boots"".

The context mentions that the music for the game was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and Toshiaki Imai. It also states that Nobuo Uematsu is best known for scoring most of the titles in the ""Final Fantasy"" series by Square Enix.

Option 1: 'Square Enix'
This option is partially correct because Square Enix is the company that published the game and Uematsu is associated with it. However, the question asks for the company that the composer is best known for, not the publisher.

The context clearly identifies the resort as 'Mar-a-Lago', thus 'Mar-a-Lago' is probably the correct option. On the opposite, 'Trump Style Magazine' is not mentioned in the context, and it is also not a resort or a National Historic Landmark. Therefore, the correct option is 'Mar-a-Lago'. <|end|>",maralago,"Several magazines named after Donald Trump were published between 1997 and 2009.

It also states that the recording originally reached number 60 on the UK Singles Chart in 1997. This information directly links the album and the single to the band Cornershop and the record label Wiiija.

On the other hand, The Beatles are a completely different band and are not mentioned in the context. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they released the album with the single that reached number 60 on the UK Singles Chart in 1997.

The context mentions that Thomas E. O'Donnell was a public opponent of the draft. This implies that the draft he opposed was the one in effect during his time. The context also mentions that the draft was employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts, including World War I.

The first option, 'Conscription in the United States', is a general term for the draft and does not specify a particular act or time period. The second option, 'The Draft Act of 1917', refers to a specific act that was passed during World War I.

Given that Thomas E. O'Donnell was a public opponent of the draft during his time, it is more likely that he was opposed to the draft in effect during World War I.

However, it does mention that Elsevier is a part of the RELX Group, which was known until 2015 as Reed Elsevier. This implies that Elsevier, and by extension the company that publishes Magnetic Resonance Imaging, was established before 2015.

Between the two options provided, '1880' and '1990', the latter is more likely to be correct.
