However, the context does not provide any information about the bus station, but it does provide information about the shopping centre. 

Since the context does not provide any information about the bus station, it is likely that the question is asking for the number of stores in the shopping centre, regardless of the bus station. 

In this case, the correct answer should be '440' because it is a more general and accurate answer, as the context does not provide any information to support the answer '300'.","Based on the context provided, it seems that the question is asking for the number of stores in the shopping centre, regardless of the bus station.

However, since the suggestion includes both '440' and '300', and the context does not explicitly state the number of stores, I would say that the correct answer is '440' due to its generality and accuracy, as it is a more likely answer given the context.
