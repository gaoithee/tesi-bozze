307,What was the official name for the draft that Thomas E. O'Donnell was a public opponent of?,conscription in the united states,the draft act of 1917," Let's analyze the options and the context provided. The context mentions that Thomas E. O'Donnell was a public opponent of the draft. The draft, as mentioned in the context, is also referred to as 'Conscription in the United States'. However, the context does not mention 'The Draft Act of 1917' specifically.

The Draft Act of 1917, also known as the Selective Service Act of 1917, was the first time the United States instituted a draft during peacetime. Given that Thomas E. O'Donnell was involved in the New York City draft riots, it is likely that he was opposing the draft during this time.

Therefore, while both options could technically be correct, the context does not provide enough information to definitively say that Thomas E. O'Donnell was opposing 'The Draft Act of 1917' specifically. However, since the context does mention that he was opposing the draft, the more general term 'Conscription in the United States' would be the safer choice.
