Today GMT is considered equivalent to UTC for UK civil purposes (but this is not formalised) and for navigation is considered equivalent to UT1 (the modern form of mean solar time at 0° longitude); these two meanings can differ by up to 0.9 s. Consequently, the term GMT should not be used for precise purposes. Deal Timeball is a Victorian maritime Greenwich Mean Time signal located on the roof of a waterfront four-storey tower in the coastal town of Deal, in Kent, England.  It was established in 1855 by the Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in collaboration with Charles V. Walker, superintendent of telegraphs for the South Eastern Railway Company.  It was built by the Lambeth firm of engineers Maudslay and Field.  The time ball, which, like the Greenwich time ball, fell at 1 pm precisely, was triggered by an electric signal directly from the Royal Observatory."

Ailbhe Ní Bhriain remarks: 'The Táin Bó Cuailnge - táin, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories.  It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior Cúchulainn (""The Hound of Ulster"") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne.  Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory.  The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first ""living version of the story"", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.'  Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations.  The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible.  The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament.  They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it.  Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work.  In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text.  If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's Táin, they are a humble one.  It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.'

Chief American Horse was a son of Old Chief Smoke, an Oglala Lakota head chief and one of the last great Shirt Wearers, a highly prestigious Lakota warrior society.

She was, right after 9/11, ""the House Intelligence Committee staffer in charge of oversight of the NSA"".  Along with William Binney, Ed Loomis, and J. Kirk Wiebe, she filed a complaint to the Department of Defense's Inspector General (DoD IG) about the National Security Agency's highly classified Trailblazer Project.  Her house was raided by armed FBI agents in 2007 after she was wrongly suspected of leaking to ""The New York Times"" reporter James Risen and to Siobhan Gorman at the ""The Baltimore Sun"" in stories about NSA warrantless surveillance.

The punitive treatment of Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis, as well as, and, in particular, then still active (rather than retired) NSA executive Thomas Andrews Drake, who had gone in confidence with anonymity assured to the DoD IG, led the Assistant Inspector General John Crane to eventually become a public whistleblower himself and also led Edward Snowden to go public with revelations rather than to report within the internal whistleblower program."
