The question asks about the location of George Washington University Hospital and Psychiatric Institute of Washington. Given the name ""George Washington University"", it is likely that the hospital is located in Washington, D.C., which is a city known for its many universities and hospitals.

Between the two options provided, 'Washington, D. C.' is the most plausible answer, as it is a city that is home to George Washington University. The other option, 'Los Angeles', is not directly related to George Washington University and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
