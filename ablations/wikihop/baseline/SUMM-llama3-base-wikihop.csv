These tanks were designed to support infantry soldiers in an attack by providing heavy armor to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. It was armed with the 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an 87.6 mm (3.45 in) 11.5 kg (25 lb) HE shell or an armor-piercing shell.

Six of these species produce venom that can cause severe injuries to humans.

The Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea. Despite their impressive size, these spiders are shy and there are no records of them biting humans. The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathelena hochstetteri) is a large spider native to New Zealand, and it is not known to bite humans.

In summary, the Dipluridae family includes venomous spiders like the Sydney funnel-web spider, which can cause serious harm to humans if bitten.

Two knots are considered equivalent if they can be transformed into each other through an ambient isotopy, a continuous deformation of the space that preserves orientation. The State University of New York at Buffalo, formerly known as the University of Buffalo, is a public research university with a strong focus on innovative research and a large endowment. It is home to William W. Menasco, a topologist known for his work in knot theory. The SUNY system, led by Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher, is one of the largest comprehensive systems of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the United States, with a total enrollment of 465,000 students and a $10.7 billion budget. The University at Buffalo, the largest campus in the SUNY system, has the greatest endowment and research funding. In topology, a homeomorphism is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function, preserving all topological properties of a given space. A circle, a simple closed shape in Euclidean geometry, is an example of a topological space. Topology is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Important topological properties include connectedness and compactness. "
