The house had large open rooms with magnificent views of the sea, and the master bath had a large tree growing right through a large hole in the roof.

Moonhole Company Limited was formed by the Johnstons, and they contributed the approximately 30 acre property to the company. Tom bequeathed his controlling interest in the company to a trust for the protection and preservation of Moonhole for posterity. The Thomas and Gladys Johnston Moonhole Conservation Trust Limited is dedicated to preserving the unique architecture, lifestyle, and vision of the Johnstons, as well as protecting the birds, wildlife, and marine life on the peninsula at the western end of Bequia.
