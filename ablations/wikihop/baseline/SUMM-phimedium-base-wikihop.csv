The context provided does not mention anything about Amir Pnueli or his death. The context is about infantry tanks developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. <|end|>,new york city," The infantry tank was a concept developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. These tanks were designed to support infantry soldiers in an attack by providing heavy armor to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. It was armed with the 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an 87.6 mm (3.45 in) 11.5 kg (25 lb) HE shell or an armor-piercing shell. However, the Bishop was a rushed attempt to create a self-propelled gun and had numerous problems. It was produced in limited numbers and soon replaced by better designs.

Another example of an infantry tank was the Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be both strong and reliable. Over 8,000 of the type were produced in eleven marks, plus various specialized variants, accounting for approximately a quarter of wartime British tank production. The many variants included riveted and welded construction, petrol and diesel engines, and a progressive increase in armament. The Valentine was supplied in large numbers to the USSR and built under license in Canada.

The Valentine tank was a successful example of an infantry tank, with over 8,000 units produced in eleven marks and various specialized variants.

Six of these species produce venom that can cause severe injuries to humans.

The Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea. Despite their impressive size, these spiders are shy and there are no records of them biting humans.
