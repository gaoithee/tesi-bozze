Dougong is a unique structural element in traditional Chinese architecture, consisting of interlocking wooden brackets. It is one of the most important elements in Chinese architecture, providing stability and support to the roof structure.

In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves. Dutch Colonial is a style of domestic architecture characterized by gambrel roofs with curved eaves along the length of the house.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a biopolymer composed of nucleotides, which are made up of a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA was determined through X-ray diffraction studies conducted by Rosalind Franklin, who passed away before the Nobel Prize was awarded.

Francis Crick and James Watson, both British scientists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on DNA was crucial in the discovery of the double helix structure, but she was not recognized with a Nobel Prize due to her untimely death in 1958.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. The prize is administered by the Nobel Foundation, which was established in 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The prize is presented to the recipients on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

In conclusion, the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson, Crick, and Franklin has revolutionized the field of medicine and biology.
