The lower slope is steeper and often features dormer windows, while the upper slope is shallower. This design allows for additional living space (garret) and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of stories. The term ""gambrel"" refers to a similar roof style with two slopes on each side, but with a shallower upper slope.

Dougong is a unique structural element in traditional Chinese architecture, consisting of interlocking wooden brackets. It is one of the most important elements in Chinese architecture, providing stability and support to the roof structure.

The Latin language, originating from the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages, is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. The Latin alphabet is widely used in various languages and has influenced many modern alphabets.

In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves. Dutch Colonial is a style of domestic architecture characterized by gambrel roofs with curved eaves along the length of the house. Modern versions of this style are referred to as Dutch Colonial Revival, a subtype of the Colonial Revival style.

Eaves are the edges of the roof that overhang the face of a wall and project beyond the side of a building. They serve to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style. The dougong bracket systems in Chinese architecture are an example of such decorative eaves. "

Two knots are considered equivalent if they can be transformed into each other through an ambient isotopy, a continuous deformation of the space that preserves orientation. The State University of New York at Buffalo, formerly known as the University of Buffalo, is a public research university with a strong focus on innovative research and a large endowment. It is home to William W. Menasco, a topologist known for his work in knot theory. The SUNY system, led by Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher, is one of the largest comprehensive systems of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the United States, with a total enrollment of 465,000 students and a $10.7 billion budget. The University at Buffalo, the largest campus in the SUNY system, has the greatest endowment and research funding. In topology, a homeomorphism is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function, preserving all topological properties of a given space. A circle, a simple closed shape in Euclidean geometry, is an example of a topological space. Topology is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Important topological properties include connectedness and compactness. "
