The album's standout track, ""Protect Ya Neck,"" features Method Man, who would later collaborate with Redman on the hit single ""Method of Modern Love.""

The album's success led to the formation of the Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop collective that would go on to achieve mainstream success with their 1993 debut album ""Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)."" The group's members pursued solo careers, with Ghostface Killah releasing his debut solo album ""Ironman"" in 1996 and Method Man collaborating with Mary J. Blige on the Grammy Award-winning single ""I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By.""

The album's production was heavily influenced by RZA's use of eerie beats and soul music samples, creating a unique sound that would become a hallmark of the Wu-Tang Clan's music. The album's success helped establish the Wu-Tang Clan as one of the most influential hip hop groups of the 1990s, and their music continues to inspire artists today. "
