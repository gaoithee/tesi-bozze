Typically these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the Earth's surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living.

The LD also works closely with the stage manager or show control programming, if show control systems are used in that production. Outside of stage lighting the job of a Lighting Designer can be much more diverse and they can be found working on rock and pop tours, corporate launches, art installation and on massive celebration spectaculars, for example the Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies.

The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. The Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel by synecdoche) is a Roman Catholic religious order founded, probably in the 12th century, on Mount Carmel in the Crusader States, hence the name Carmelites. However, historical records about its origin remain uncertain. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived, and this is likely to be a later extrapolation by hagiographers. The term Augustinians, named after Augustine of Hippo (354430), applies to two separate types of Catholic religious orders and some Anglican religious orders. Within Anglicanism the Rule of St Augustine is followed only by women, who form several different communities of Augustinian nuns in the Anglican Communion. Within Roman Catholicism Augustinians may be members of either one of two separate and distinct types of Order: Charism.
In a religious community, ""charism"" is the particular contribution that each religious order, congregation or family and its individual members embody. The teaching and writing of Augustine, the Augustinian Rule, and the lives and experiences of Augustinians over sixteen centuries help define the ethos of the order. The Franciscans are a group of related mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi. These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis.

The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building. Dougong is a unique structural element of interlocking wooden brackets, one of the most important elements in traditional Chinese architecture. A gambrel or gambrel roof is a usually symmetrical two-sided roof with two slopes on each side. (The usual architectural term in eighteenth-century England and America was ""Dutch roof."") The upper slope is positioned at a shallow angle, while the lower slope is steep. This design provides the advantages of a sloped roof while maximizing headroom inside the building's upper level and shortening what would otherwise be a tall roof. The name comes from the Medieval Latin word ""gamba"", meaning ""horse's hock or leg"". The term ""gambrel"" is of American origin, the older, European name being a curb (kerb, kirb) roof. Europeans historically did not distinguish between a gambrel roof and a mansard roof but called both types a mansard.

A number of genera, including that of the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax""), used to be classified in this family but have now been moved to Hexathelidae. Atrax is a genus of venomous spiders found in Australia. It is a member of the subfamily Atracinae, the Australian funnel-web spiders, part of the Hexathelidae family. The genus was erected by the Reverend Octavius Pickard-Cambridge in 1877 for the species ""Atrax robustus"". 
, the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species: Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as ""tarantulas"". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. Atracinae, commonly known as Australian funnel-web spiders, is a subfamily of spiders in the funnel-web spider family Hexathelidae. All members of the subfamily are native to Australia. Atracinae consists of three genera: ""Atrax"", ""Hadronyche"", and ""Illawarra"", comprising 35 species. A number of the species produce venom which is dangerous to humans and bites by spiders of six of the species have caused severe injuries to victims. The bite of the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus"") is potentially deadly, but there have been no fatalities since the introduction of modern first aid techniques and antivenom. Venom is a form of toxin secreted by an animal for the purpose of causing harm to another.  The Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus"") is a species of venomous mygalomorph spider native to eastern Australia, usually found within a radius of Sydney. It is a member of a group of spiders known as Australian funnel-web spiders. Its bite is capable of causing serious injury or death in humans if left untreated. Hexathele hochstetteri , or the banded tunnelweb spider , is a large New Zealand spider in the family Hexathelidae . Despite its impressive size it is shy , and there are no records of these spiders biting humans . Hexathelidae is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea, and one of two families (along with Dipluridae) of spiders known as funnel-webs. This order is sometimes incorrectly referred to (in unknown references) as the venomous funnel-web tarantulas, due to the inclusion of the Australian funnel-web spiders, including the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus"").

In a modern sense, comedy (from the , ""kmidía"") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old"". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

Named after his father , Marbury spent most of his early life in Maryland around his home . Marbury became a Georgetown businessman and member of the Federalist Party .

Marbury had actively campaigned for Adams ( and against Jefferson ) in the presidential election of 1800 . Jefferson refused to honor Adams ' appointments on the grounds that Adams ' paperwork had not been delivered to the proper offices before the change of administration had taken place . Marbury then sued Jefferson 's secretary of state , James Madison , in the Supreme Court , asking it issue a writ of mandamus to force the Jefferson administration to honor Adams ' appointments . Marbury 's suit clarified the right of judicial review . Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall 's two - pronged decision averred that while the Court did not have the authority to issue the writ Marbury had requested , it did have the authority to review the constitutionality of actions of the federal executive and legislative branches of government , including those of the Adams and Jefferson administrations .

It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. The Megarian school of philosophy, which flourished in the 4th century BC, was founded by Euclides of Megara, one of the pupils of Socrates. Its ethical teachings were derived from Socrates, recognizing a single good, which was apparently combined with the Eleatic doctrine of Unity. Some of Euclides' successors developed logic to such an extent that they became a separate school, known as the Dialectical school. Their work on modal logic, logical conditionals, and propositional logic played an important role in the development of logic in antiquity. Euclid of Megara (also Euclides, Eucleides c. 435  c. 365 BCE) was a Greek Socratic philosopher who founded the Megarian school of philosophy. He was a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE, and was present at his death. He held the supreme good to be one, eternal and unchangeable, and denied the existence of anything contrary to the good. Editors and translators in the Middle Ages often confused him with Euclid of Alexandria when discussing the latter's ""Elements"". Pyrrho (""Pyrrn"", c. 360 BC  c. 270 BC), was a Greek philosopher of Classical Antiquity and is credited as being the first Greek skeptic philosopher. Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and Southwestern Asia. Clinomachus ( Greek :  ; 4th - century BCE ) , was a Megarian philosopher from Thurii . He is said by Diogenes Laërtius to have been the first who composed treatises on the fundamental principles of dialectics , and he is described as the founder of the Dialectical school .

The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. In Norse mythology , Baugi is a giant . He is the son of Gilling , brother of Suttungr and paternal uncle of Gunnlöð . Baugi is attested to in Skáldskaparmál in Snorri 's Prose Edda , and does not appear in other texts . Due to his absence in other relevant mythological texts , numerous scholars have argued that Baugi either comes from a source that is not extant today or was an invention of Snorri 's , accidental or intentional . Germanic mythology consists of the body of myths native to the Germanic peoples. Commonly featuring narratives focused on Germanic deities and a large variety of other entities, Germanic mythology dates from the Proto-Germanic period and reaches beyond the Christianization of the Germanic peoples and into modern Germanic folklore. Germanic mythology includes Norse mythology, Anglo-Saxon mythology, and Continental Germanic mythology. Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. In Norse mythology, Suttungr was a ""jötunn"", a son of Gilling, who (along with Suttungr's mother) had been murdered by Fjalar and Galar. The jötunn (anglicized jotunn or jotun, plural jötnar , or ; Old Norse jtunn , Icelandic jötunn ; often glossed as ""giant"" or ""ettin"") are a mythological race that live in Jötunheimr, one of the nine worlds of Norse cosmology. They were banished there by the Æsir who refused them entry to their world, Asgard. The Jötnar can be seen throughout Norse mythology. They frequently interact with the Æsir, as well as the Vanir. They are usually in opposition to, or in competition with them, but also interact with them in a non-hostile manner. Some Jötnar even intermarry with the Æsir and Vanir, and many are named as parents or grandparents of Æsir such as Thor and Odin. This very complex relationship between these two comparable races develops most notably in the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, ultimately making it difficult to distinguish them from the more familiar Norse gods."

They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species. Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just ""binomial""), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens"". The ""formal"" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work ""Species Plantarum"" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book ""Pinax theatri botanici"" (English, ""Illustrated exposition of plants"") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies , named by Arthur Francis Hemming in honour of Vladimir Nabokov , who extensively studied the Polyommatinae subfamily . Species include : Nabokovia faga ( Dognin 1895 )"

Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house.
Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the ""floor"" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election."
