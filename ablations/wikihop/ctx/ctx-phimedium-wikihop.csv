This action, taken with the consent of the United Kingdom as per the Quebec Agreement, resulted in the deaths of at least 129,000 people. The bombings were part of the final stage of World War II, a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945 and involved over 30 countries. The war was characterized by mass civilian casualties, including the Holocaust, which saw the systematic murder of approximately six million Jews, including 1.5 million children.

The Battle of Maastricht was a key engagement during the German Campaign on the Western Front. The objective was to capture the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael, a neutralized fortress that had been taken by glider-borne German troops in May 1940. The fort's capture was crucial for the Germans to advance into Belgium and split the Allied forces.

Fort Eben-Emael, located between Liège and Maastricht on the Belgian-Dutch border, was constructed between 1931 and 1935 and was considered impregnable at the time. The successful neutralization of the fort by the Germans paved the way for their ground forces to enter Belgium without facing fire from the fort. The fort has since been preserved and is open for public visitation.

In summary, the United States' use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Battle of Maastricht, and the capture of Fort Eben-Emael were significant events during World War II. The war resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.

The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. It was armed with the 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an 87.6 mm (3.45 in) 11.5 kg (25 lb) HE shell or an armor-piercing shell.

They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on DNA was crucial in the discovery of the double helix structure, but she was not recognized with a Nobel Prize due to her untimely death in 1958.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. The prize is administered by the Nobel Foundation, which was established in 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The prize is presented to the recipients on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

In conclusion, the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson, Crick, and Franklin has revolutionized the field of medicine and biology.

The fort's capture was crucial for the Germans to advance into Belgium and split the Allied forces.

Fort Eben-Emael, located between Liège and Maastricht on the Belgian-Dutch border, was constructed between 1931 and 1935 and was considered impregnable at the time. The successful neutralization of the fort by the Germans paved the way for their ground forces to enter Belgium without facing fire from the fort. The fort has since been preserved and is open for public visitation.

In summary, the United States' use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Battle of Maastricht, and the capture of Fort Eben-Emael were significant events during World War II. The war resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.

This family used to include genera like Atrax, which are now classified under the Hexathelidae family. Atrax, specifically the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus""), is a venomous spider found in eastern Australia. Its bite can cause serious injury or death in humans if left untreated. However, modern first aid techniques and antivenom have prevented fatalities.

The Theraphosidae family, commonly known as tarantulas, comprises around 900 species of large and often hairy arachnids. While some species can cause severe allergic reactions, they are not generally dangerous to humans. The Atracinae subfamily, also known as Australian funnel-web spiders, consists of three genera: Atrax, Hadronyche, and Illawarra, with 35 species. Six of these species produce venom that can cause severe injuries to humans.

The Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea. Despite their impressive size, these spiders are shy and there are no records of them biting humans. The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathelena hochstetteri) is a large spider native to New Zealand, and it is not known to bite humans.

Francis Crick and James Watson, both British scientists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on DNA was crucial in the discovery of the double helix structure, but she was not recognized with a Nobel Prize due to her untimely death in 1958.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. The prize is administered by the Nobel Foundation, which was established in 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The prize is presented to the recipients on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.
