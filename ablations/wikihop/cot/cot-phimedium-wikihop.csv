- ecdysozoa: This is a superphylum that includes several phyla, but it is not the parent taxon of Amphiesmenoptera.
- fungi: This is a kingdom, not a parent taxon of Amphiesmenoptera.
- insects: This is the correct answer, as Insecta is the class that includes all insects, and Amphiesmenoptera is a clade within this class.
- lepidoptera: This is an order within Amphiesmenoptera, not its parent taxon.
- nautilus: This is a genus of cephalopods, not related to Amphiesmenoptera.

Two knots are considered equivalent if they can be transformed into each other through an ambient isotopy, a continuous deformation of the space that preserves orientation. The State University of New York at Buffalo, formerly known as the University of Buffalo, is a public research university with a strong focus on innovative research and a large endowment. It is home to William W. Menasco, a topologist known for his work in knot theory. The SUNY system, led by Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher, is one of the largest comprehensive systems of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the United States, with a total enrollment of 465,000 students and a $10.7 billion budget. The University at Buffalo, the largest campus in the SUNY system, has the greatest endowment and research funding. In topology, a homeomorphism is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function, preserving all topological properties of a given space. A circle, a simple closed shape in Euclidean geometry, is an example of a topological space. Topology is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Important topological properties include connectedness and compactness. "
