Rowling man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head. “Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces. “This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,” she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. “Well, they’re easy enough, they’re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. … Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know where we’re going to get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that’ll be tricky, too — and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.” “Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a\\n[2] P a g e | 240 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – J. K. Rowling Harry showed her Goyle’s hair. “Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,” Hermione said, holding up a small sack. “You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe and Goyle.” The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly. “I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. “It looks like the book says it should … once we’ve drunk it, we’ll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.” “Now what?” Ron whispered. “We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.” Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into the first glass. The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow. “Urgh\\n[3] P a g e | 178 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – J. K. Rowling “There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. “Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We’d be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect —” “If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you wil l let us know, won’t you?” said Ron irritably. “All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s us.” “But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed. “No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.” “What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together. “Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —” “D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?” muttered Ron. “It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins.\\n \\n\\n    Is the answer correct? Why or why not?\\n \""
