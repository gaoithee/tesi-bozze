Hell, in many mythological, folklore and religious traditions, is a place of torment and punishment in an afterlife. It is viewed by most Abrahamic traditions as punishment. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as eternal destinations. Religions with a cyclic history often depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations. Typically these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the Earth's surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include Heaven, Purgatory, Paradise, and Limbo. The afterlife (also referred to as life after death or the hereafter) is the concept of a realm, or the realm itself (whether physical or transcendental), in which an essential part of an individual's identity or consciousness continues to exist after the death of the body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire soul or spirit, of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian nirvana. Belief in an afterlife, which may be naturalistic or supernatural, is in contrast to the belief in oblivion after death.

The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. The Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel by synecdoche) is a Roman Catholic religious order founded, probably in the 12th century, on Mount Carmel in the Crusader States, hence the name Carmelites. However, historical records about its origin remain uncertain. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived, and this is likely to be a later extrapolation by hagiographers. The term Augustinians, named after Augustine of Hippo (354430), applies to two separate types of Catholic religious orders and some Anglican religious orders. Within Anglicanism the Rule of St Augustine is followed only by women, who form several different communities of Augustinian nuns in the Anglican Communion. Within Roman Catholicism Augustinians may be members of either one of two separate and distinct types of Order: Charism.
In a religious community, ""charism"" is the particular contribution that each religious order, congregation or family and its individual members embody. The teaching and writing of Augustine, the Augustinian Rule, and the lives and experiences of Augustinians over sixteen centuries help define the ethos of the order. The Franciscans are a group of related mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi. These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. Theses orders adheres to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary, among many others.

In a modern sense, comedy (from the , ""kmidía"") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old"". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes.

These tanks were designed to support infantry soldiers in an attack by providing heavy armor to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. It was armed with the 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an 87.6 mm (3.45 in) 11.5 kg (25 lb) HE shell or an armor-piercing shell.

Another example of an infantry tank was the Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be both strong and reliable. Over 8,000 of the type were produced in eleven marks, plus various specialized variants, accounting for approximately a quarter of wartime British tank production. The many variants included riveted and welded construction, petrol and diesel engines, and a progressive increase in armament. The Valentine was supplied in large numbers to the USSR and built under license in Canada.

The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. The Megarian school of philosophy, which flourished in the 4th century BC, was founded by Euclides of Megara, one of the pupils of Socrates. Its ethical teachings were derived from Socrates, recognizing a single good, which was apparently combined with the Eleatic doctrine of Unity. Some of Euclides' successors developed logic to such an extent that they became a separate school, known as the Dialectical school. Their work on modal logic, logical conditionals, and propositional logic played an important role in the development of logic in antiquity. Euclid of Megara (also Euclides, Eucleides c. 435  c. 365 BCE) was a Greek Socratic philosopher who founded the Megarian school of philosophy. He was a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE, and was present at his death. He held the supreme good to be one, eternal and unchangeable, and denied the existence of anything contrary to the good. Editors and translators in the Middle Ages often confused him with Euclid of Alexandria when discussing the latter's ""Elements"".

Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny. The uterus, also known as the womb, is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ in humans and most other mammals. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. The nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils and is responsible for respiration. Altricial species are those whose young are incapable of moving around on their own soon after birth or hatching. Mammals are vertebrates with specific characteristics such as a neocortex, hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands. The skeleton provides support and protection to the body, while muscles enable movement and maintain posture. Joints connect bones and allow for movement. Birth, or parturition, is the process of bringing forth offspring, which in mammals is initiated by hormones. Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside the female's uterus. Cartilage is a resilient tissue that forms a part of the skeletal system. Hormones are signaling molecules that regulate physiology and behavior. White blood cells are involved in protecting the body against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. Bones are rigid organs that constitute part of the vertebrate skeleton, providing support, protection, and enabling movement. The ear is the organ of hearing and balance in mammals. Marsupials are mammals with distinctive characteristics, including carrying their young in a pouch. Precocial species are those whose young are relatively mature and mobile from birth or hatching. Atelosteogenesis, type II, is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development. ",[]

They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species. Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just ""binomial""), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens"". The ""formal"" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work ""Species Plantarum"" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book ""Pinax theatri botanici"" (English, ""Illustrated exposition of plants"") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies , named by Arthur Francis Hemming in honour of Vladimir Nabokov , who extensively studied the Polyommatinae subfamily .

A film, also called a motion picture, is a series of still images that create the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry, with films being created by photographing actual scenes, drawings, or miniature models using traditional animation techniques or CGI and computer animation.

Parody is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work's subject, author, style, or some other target through satiric or ironic imitation. It can be found in various art forms, including literature, music, animation, gaming, and film. Parody is not always at the expense of the parodied text, as it can also provide polemical allusions and critique. ",[]

If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house.
Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments.
