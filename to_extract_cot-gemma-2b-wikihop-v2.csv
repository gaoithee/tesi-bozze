This family used to include genera like Atrax, which are now classified under the Hexathelidae family. Atrax, specifically the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus""), is a venomous spider found in eastern Australia. Its bite can cause serious injury or death in humans if left untreated. However, modern first aid techniques and antivenom have prevented fatalities.

The Theraphosidae family, commonly known as tarantulas, comprises around 900 species of large and often hairy arachnids. While some species can cause severe allergic reactions, they are not generally dangerous to humans. The Atracinae subfamily, also known as Australian funnel-web spiders, consists of three genera: Atrax, Hadronyche, and Illawarra, with 35 species. Six of these species produce venom that can cause severe injuries to humans.

The Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea. Despite their impressive size, these spiders are shy and there are no records of them biting humans. The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathelena hochstetteri) is a large spider native to New Zealand, and it is not known to bite humans.

In summary, the Dipluridae family includes venomous spiders like the Sydney funnel-web spider, which can cause serious harm to humans if bitten. However, modern first aid techniques and antivenom have made fatalities rare. The Theraphosidae family, which includes tarantulas, is not generally dangerous to humans, and the Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is not known to bite humans. "

The structure of DNA was determined through X-ray diffraction studies conducted by Rosalind Franklin, who passed away before the Nobel Prize was awarded.

Francis Crick and James Watson, both British scientists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite.
