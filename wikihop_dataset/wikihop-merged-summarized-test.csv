DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a biopolymer composed of nucleotides, which are made up of a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA was determined through X-ray diffraction studies conducted by Rosalind Franklin, who passed away before the Nobel Prize was awarded.

Francis Crick and James Watson, both British scientists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on DNA was crucial in the discovery of the double helix structure, but she was not recognized with a Nobel Prize due to her untimely death in 1958.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. The prize is administered by the Nobel Foundation, which was established in 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The prize is presented to the recipients on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

Lucien Bouchard, the founder of the Bloc Québécois, served as the 27th Premier of Quebec from 1996 to 2001 and was a central figure in the 1995 Quebec referendum.

The lower slope is steeper and often features dormer windows, while the upper slope is shallower. This design allows for additional living space (garret) and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of stories. The term ""gambrel"" refers to a similar roof style with two slopes on each side, but with a shallower upper slope.

Dougong is a unique structural element in traditional Chinese architecture, consisting of interlocking wooden brackets. It is one of the most important elements in Chinese architecture, providing stability and support to the roof structure.

The Latin language, originating from the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages, is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. The Latin alphabet is widely used in various languages and has influenced many modern alphabets.

In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves. Dutch Colonial is a style of domestic architecture characterized by gambrel roofs with curved eaves along the length of the house. Modern versions of this style are referred to as Dutch Colonial Revival, a subtype of the Colonial Revival style.

Eaves are the edges of the roof that overhang the face of a wall and project beyond the side of a building. They serve to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style.

The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank.

Over 8,000 of the type were produced in eleven marks, plus various specialized variants, accounting for approximately a quarter of wartime British tank production.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a biopolymer composed of nucleotides, which are made up of a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA was determined through X-ray diffraction studies conducted by Rosalind Franklin, who passed away before the Nobel Prize was awarded.

Francis Crick and James Watson, both British scientists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on DNA was crucial in the discovery of the double helix structure, but she was not recognized with a Nobel Prize due to her untimely death in 1958.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. The prize is administered by the Nobel Foundation, which was established in 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The prize is presented to the recipients on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

In conclusion, the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson, Crick, and Franklin has revolutionized the field of medicine and biology.
