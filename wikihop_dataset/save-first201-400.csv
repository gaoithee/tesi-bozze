Reptiles are tetrapod animals with a bony skull and limbs or limb-like appendages. They are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. Reptiles have a unique skin covered in scales or scutes, which helps prevent water loss.

The skull of reptiles is composed of two parts: the cranium and the mandible. The cranium houses the brain, while the mandible forms the lower jaw. Reptiles have a well-developed jaw structure, which allows them to capture and consume a wide variety of prey.

Reptiles reproduce through internal fertilization, with most species laying eggs. The eggs have a leathery or hard shell, which protects the developing embryo from desiccation and predation. Some reptiles, such as certain species of snakes and lizards, give birth to live young.

Reptiles have a diverse range of adaptations that allow them to thrive in various environments. For example, crocodiles have a streamlined body and powerful jaws, enabling them to be efficient predators in aquatic habitats. Snakes have highly flexible bodies and specialized jaw muscles, allowing them to swallow prey much larger than their heads. Lizards have well-developed limbs and claws, which help them climb and navigate their surroundings.

Reptiles play essential roles in ecosystems as both predators and prey. They help control populations of other animals, such as insects and small mammals, and serve as food sources for larger predators.

In summary, herpetology is the study of amphibians and reptiles, which are tetrapod animals with unique adaptations that allow them to thrive in various environments.

Circumcision, the removal of the foreskin from the human penis, is a procedure with varying positions among world's major medical organizations. While some consider it to have no benefit and significant risks, others see it as having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the effectiveness of circumcision in preventing HIV in the developed world is unclear.

Circumcision is associated with reduced rates of cancer-causing forms of HPV and risk of both UTIs and penile cancer. However, prevention of these conditions is not a justification for routine circumcision of infants. Studies have shown that circumcision performed by medical providers has a typical complication rate of 1.5% for babies and 6% for older children, with few cases of severe complications. Complication rates are higher when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age.

The origin of circumcision is not known with certainty, with theories ranging from religious sacrifice to a rite of passage marking a boy's entrance into adulthood. It is part of religious law in Judaism and is an established practice in Islam, Coptic Christianity, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

Some of these species, like the coucals and anis, are sometimes classified as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae, respectively. Swallows and martins, belonging to the family Hirundinidae, are known for their adaptation to aerial feeding.

Species are defined as the basic unit of biological classification, typically characterized by the ability to produce fertile offspring through sexual reproduction. However, defining species can be problematic, especially in species complexes where boundaries between closely related species become unclear.

Binomial nomenclature, introduced by Carl Linnaeus, is a formal system of naming species using two parts: the genus name and the species name. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens.""

Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of specialized reproductive cells called gametes, which contain half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. This process, known as meiosis, results in the creation of a single-celled zygote with genetic material from both parents.

Birds, belonging to the clade Passeri, are characterized by their vocal organ, which produces diverse and elaborate bird songs. They are classified as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, with approximately ten thousand species.

139,Where did Amir Pnueli pass away?,new york city,"['new york city', 'york']"," The infantry tank was a concept developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. These tanks were designed to support infantry soldiers in an attack by providing heavy armor to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. It was armed with the 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an 87.6 mm (3.45 in) 11.5 kg (25 lb) HE shell or an armor-piercing shell. However, the Bishop was a rushed attempt to create a self-propelled gun and had numerous problems. It was produced in limited numbers and soon replaced by better designs.

Another example of an infantry tank was the Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be both strong and reliable. Over 8,000 of the type were produced in eleven marks, plus various specialized variants, accounting for approximately a quarter of wartime British tank production. The many variants included riveted and welded construction, petrol and diesel engines, and a progressive increase in armament. The Valentine was supplied in large numbers to the USSR and built under license in Canada.

In summary, infantry tanks were developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II to support infantry soldiers in an attack.

The league is considered the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The NHL was founded in 1917 by a group of businessmen led by Canadian Ambrose O'Brien, who had previously founded the National Hockey Association (NHA). The NHA was the direct predecessor to the NHL, and it introduced'six-man hockey' by removing the 'rover' position in 1911.

The NHL's history is marked by several notable events and figures. One of the most significant was the creation of the Stanley Cup in 1892, a championship trophy awarded annually to the NHL playoff winner. The Cup was originally commissioned as the ""Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup"" and was named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada at the time. The first Cup was awarded to Montreal HC in 1893.

The NHL faced competition from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), a rival professional ice hockey organization based in the western United States. The two leagues eventually reached a gentlemen's agreement in 1915, where their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. However, this arrangement was short-lived, and the NHL was officially established as the ""de facto"" championship trophy of the league in 1926, and later the ""de jure"" NHL championship prize in 1947.

The NHL has been home to many legendary players and teams throughout its history. One of the most famous teams is the Montreal Canadiens, founded in 1909 by Ambrose O'Brien. The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times, more than any other team in the league.

The NHL has also been influenced by the Canadian honours system, which traditionally restricted Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. This led to the creation of a separate Canadian honours system, including the Order of Canada, which recognizes outstanding achievement, dedication to the community, and service to the nation.

It served as the capital of the Roman Empire until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and continued as the capital of the Byzantine Empire until its conquest by the Ottoman Empire in 1453.

Architecture played a significant role in the Roman Empire, with the systematic use of arches appearing as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture. The Ancient Romans were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures, including bridges, aqueducts, and buildings. The arch was a curved structure that spanned a space and could support weight above it, and it was a defining feature of Roman architecture.

Set in the years following the Great Depression in Lorain, Ohio, the story centers on a young African American girl named Pecola who is taunted for her dark skin color. Pecola's desire for blue eyes stems from her belief that they would make her beautiful and loved.

In ""Love,"" Morrison tells the story of Bill Cosey, a charismatic hotel owner who dies in the 1930s. The novel follows the lives of his granddaughter, Christine, and his widow, Heed, who are sworn enemies but share his mansion. The story is told through a split narrative, jumping back and forth between different time periods. The characters in the novel all have some connection to Bill Cosey, and Morrison introduces a character named Junior, who serves as a medium to connect the dead Bill Cosey to the world of the living.

Wotherspoon, a contemporary of Charles Allan Gilbert, is renowned for his optical illusion art prints. His works, such as ""Gossip: And Satan Came Also"" and ""Social Donkey,"" often employ visual puns and double images to create illusions that challenge the viewer's perception. Wotherspoon's art explores the concept of illusions, which are distortions of the senses that reveal how the brain organizes and interprets sensory stimulation.

Illusions can be categorized into three main types: literal optical illusions, physiological illusions, and cognitive illusions. Literal optical illusions create images that differ from the objects that make them, while physiological illusions result from excessive stimulation of specific sensory mechanisms. Cognitive illusions, on the other hand, arise from unconscious inferences. Pathological visual illusions occur due to exaggerated physiological visual perception mechanisms.

Wotherspoon's artwork also draws inspiration from the concept of vanitas, a category of symbolic works of art that emphasize the transient nature of earthly life and the worthlessness of material pursuits. The Latin phrase ""Vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas,"" meaning ""All is vanity, all is vanity, all is vanity,"" is a prominent theme in vanitas art. This phrase originates from the Ecclesiastes, a book in the Old Testament that reflects on the futility of human endeavors.

In his famous drawing ""All Is Vanity,"" C. Allan Gilbert employs a double image to create a visual pun. The image of a woman admiring herself in a mirror, when viewed from a distance, appears to be a human skull. This artwork serves as a memento mori, a reminder of the inevitability of death and the transient nature of life.

In summary, George A. Wotherspoon's optical illusion art prints explore the concept of illusions and draw inspiration from the vanitas theme. His artwork challenges the viewer's perception and reminds them of the fleeting nature of earthly life."
