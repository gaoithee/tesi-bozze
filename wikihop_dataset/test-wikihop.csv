2,What is the parent taxon of Australosuchus?,crocodilia,"['animal', 'area', 'crocodile', 'crocodilia', 'homo', 'mekosuchinae', 'plant', 'tomistoma']"," Mekosuchinae was a subfamily of crocodiles that lived in Australia and the South Pacific. They first appeared in the Eocene epoch in Australia and survived until the Pleistocene in Australia and until the arrival of humans in the Pacific islands of Fiji, New Caledonia, and Vanuatu. There is some debate over whether Mekosuchinae should be classified as a subfamily within Crocodylidae or as a distinct family, Mekosuchidae, within the superfamily Crocodyloidea.

Australosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodylian that belonged to the Mekosuchinae subfamily. The only known species, Australosuchus clarkae, lived during the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene periods in southern Australia. The generic name Australosuchus means ""Southern crocodile."" The species was described in 1991 based on fossil material found at Lake Palankarinna in South Australia. ","Mekosuchinae was a subfamily of crocodiles from Australia and the South Pacific that have now become extinct. They first appear in the fossil record in the Eocene in Australia, and survived until the Pleistocene in Australia and until the arrival of humans in the Pacific islands of Fiji, New Caledonia and Vanuatu. There is however disagreement on whether or not Mekosuchinae is a subfamily within Crocodylidae, or a distinct family, Mekosuchidae, on its own within the superfamily Crocodyloidea. Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes ""Tomistoma"", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes ""Tomistoma"", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just ""binomial""), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens"". The ""formal"" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work ""Species Plantarum"" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book ""Pinax theatri botanici"" (English, ""Illustrated exposition of plants"") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. Australosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodylian belonging to the subfamily Mekosuchinae . The type and only known species Australosuchus clarkae lived during the Late Oligocene and the Early Miocene of southern Australia . The generic name Australosuchus means `` Southern crocodile '' .

","A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman ""provincia"", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean ""outside the capital city"". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy. Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term ""municipality"" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French ""municipalité"" and Latin ""municipalis"". A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.

Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the ""goal crease"" (often referred to simply as "" the crease"" or ""the net"").

It can be played in both upright and horizontal positions, allowing for tapping, picking, slapping, or strumming. Don Schiff, a versatile musician, is one of the earliest and most prominent Chapman Stick players. He has used the instrument in various recording sessions and live performances, developing new techniques such as ""tapping while plucking"" and ""slide technique"" using a carabiner. Schiff also played the NS/Stick, a collaboration between Chapman and Steinberger, which incorporated design ideas from both the Chapman Stick and Steinberger's instruments. Schiff's contributions to the Chapman Stick and NS/Stick have helped popularize these innovative instruments in the music industry. ","A carabinier (also sometimes spelled carabineer or carbineer) is in principle a soldier armed with a carbine. A carbine is a shorter version of a musket or rifle. Carabiniers were first introduced during the Napoleonic wars in Europe. The word is derived from the identical French word ""carabinier"". The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. The Chapman Stick (""The Stick"") is an electric musical instrument devised by Emmett Chapman in the early 1970s. A member of the guitar family, the Chapman Stick usually has ten or twelve individually tuned strings and has been used on music recordings to play bass lines, melody lines, chords, or textures. Designed as a fully polyphonic chordal instrument, it can also cover several of these musical parts simultaneously.

His reign saw widespread violence against Armenians and Bulgarians, and he suspended the constitution and parliament in 1878, reinstating absolute rule. The Young Turk Revolution in 1908 restored constitutional rule, which Abdul Hamid II was removed from power. The document also mentions various geographical and historical contexts, including the Ottoman Empire, the Young Turk Revolution, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, World War I, and the Balkan Peninsula. It also discusses the geographical locations of Lake Urmia, Cairo, Iran, the Arab world, Azerbaijan, the Red Sea, Europe, Asia, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire, ancient Egypt, and the Balkan Peninsula. ","Abdul Hamid II (""`Abdül-amd-i sânî"" 21 September 184210 February 1918) was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the last Sultan to exert effective autocratic control over the fracturing state. He oversaw a period of decline in the power and extent of the Ottoman Empire, including widespread pogroms and government-sanctioned massacres of Armenians and Bulgarians, as well as an assassination attempt, ruling from 31 August 1876 until he was deposed shortly after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, on 27 April 1909. In accordance with an agreement made with the republican Young Ottomans, he promulgated the first Ottoman constitution of 1876 on 23 December 1876, which was a sign of progressive thinking that marked his early rule. Soon, however, he claimed Western influence on Ottoman affairs and citing disagreements with Parliament, Abdul Hamid suspended both the short-lived constitution and Parliament in 1878 and seized absolute power, ending the first constitutional era of the Ottoman Empire. Abdul Hamid's 1909 removal from the throne was hailed by most Ottoman citizens, who welcomed the return to constitutional rule after three decades. Lake Urmia (""Daryche-ye Ormiye"" ""Urmiya gölü"") is an endorheic salt lake in Iranian Azerbaijan, Iran and near Iran's border with Turkey. The lake is between the provinces of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan in Iran, and west of the southern portion of the Caspian Sea. At its full size, it was the largest lake in the Middle East and the sixth-largest saltwater lake on Earth with a surface area of approximately , length, width, and depth. The lake has shrunk to 10% of its former size due to damming of the rivers that flow into it and pumping of groundwater from the area. Cairo (; ', ') is the capital and largest city of Egypt. The city's metropolitan area is the largest in the Middle East and the Arab world, and 15th-largest in the world, and is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, modern Cairo was founded in 969 CE by Jawhar al-Siqilli (""the Sicilian"") of the Fatimid dynasty, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. Cairo has long been a center of the region's political and cultural life, and is nicknamed ""the city of a thousand minarets"" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the ""de facto"" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.

These Arab states occupy an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. The contemporary Arab world has a combined population of around 422 million people, over half of whom are under 25 years of age. Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west. The Armenian Highlands (also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus. To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and converges with the Armenian Highlands to the east of Cappadocia. To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly by about to above sea level. The Caucasus extends to the northeast of the Armenian Highlands. To the southwest of the Armenian Highlands is Upper Mesopotamia. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) (classical ), also known as Dashnaktsutyun (in a short form, ""Dashnak""), is an Armenian nationalist and socialist political party founded in 1890 in Tiflis, Russian Empire (now Tbilisi, Georgia) in 1890 by Christapor Mikaelian, Stepan Zorian, and Simon Zavarian.

The Nile ( ""en-Nl"",  ""an-Nl"" ""P(h)iaro""; Ancient Egyptian: ""'p"" and ""Iteru""; Biblical Hebrew: , ""Ha-Ye'or"") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an ""international"" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. Mehmed II (""Memed-i sn""; Modern ; 30 March 1432  3 May 1481), best known as Mehmed the Conqueror, was an Ottoman sultan who ruled first for a short time from August 1444 to September 1446, and later from February 1451 to May 1481. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and brought an end to the Eastern Roman Empire. Mehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. Mehmed is considered a hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world. Among other things, Istanbul's Fatih district, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge and Fatih Mosque are named after him. A minaret (', ,), from ', ""lighthouse"", also known as ""Goldaste"", is a distinctive architectural structure akin to a tower and typically found adjacent to mosques. Generally a tall spire with a conical or onion-shaped crown, usually either free-standing or taller than associated support structure. The basic form of a minaret includes a base, shaft, and gallery. Styles vary regionally and by period. Minarets provide a visual focal point and are traditionally used for the Muslim call to prayer.

Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. Bey (/Bey, / ""Beye"", / ""Beg"" or ""Beyg"") is a Turkish title for chieftain, traditionally applied to the leaders (for men) of small tribal groups. 
The feminine equivalent title was Begum.
The regions or provinces where ""beys"" ruled or which they administered were called ""beylik"", roughly meaning ""khanate"", ""emirate"" or ""principality"" in the first case, ""province"" or ""governorate"" in the second (the equivalent of duchy in other parts of Europe).
Today, the word is still used informally as a social title for men (somewhat like the English word ""mister"" and the French word ""monsieur"", which literally means ""my lord""). Unlike ""mister"" however, it follows the name and is used generally with first names and not with last names. The Red Sea (also the Erythraean Sea) is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden.

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. Jordan ('), officially The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ('), is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west. Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre. Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. The First Republic of Armenia, officially known at the time of its existence as the Republic of Armenia (classical ), was the first modern Armenian state since the loss of Armenian statehood in the Middle Ages. The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; """") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area). Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics. The Armenian national liberation movement (""Hay azgayin-azatagrakan sharzhum"") aimed at the establishment of an Armenian state. It included social, cultural, but primarily political and military movements that reached their height during World War I and the following years. Anatolia (from Greek , '  ""east"" or ""(sun)rise""; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from '  ""small Asia""; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. Islamic architecture encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day. What today is known as Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine and all other lands which the Muslims conquered in the 7th and 8th centuries. Further east, it was also influenced by Chinese and Indian architecture as Islam spread to Southeast Asia. The principal Islamic architectural types are: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as public baths, fountains and domestic architecture. Urmia (() is the second largest city in the Iranian Azerbaijan and the capital of West Azerbaijan Province. Urmia is situated at an altitude of 1,330 m above sea level, and is located along the Shahar Chay river (City River) on the Urmia Plain. Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest salt lakes, lies to the east of the city and the mountainous Turkish border area lies to the west. The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both ""Byzantine Empire"" and ""Eastern Roman Empire"" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the ""Roman Empire"" (tr. ), or ""Romania"", and to themselves as ""Romans"". World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. Aram Manukian (classical ), also referred to as simply Aram (19 March 187929 January 1919), was an Armenian revolutionary, statesman, and a leading member of the nationalist Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) party. He is widely regarded as the founder of the First Republic of Armenia. An empire is defined as ""an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire."" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. The Young Turk Revolution (July 1908) of the Ottoman Empire was when the Young Turks movement restored the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and ushered in multi-party politics in a two stage electoral system (electoral law) under the Ottoman parliament. More than 3 decades earlier in 1876, constitutional monarchy had been established under Sultan Abdul Hamid II during a period of time known as the First Constitutional Era, which only lasted for two years before Abdul Hamid suspended it and restored autocratic powers to himself. On 24 July 1908, Abdul Hamid capitulated and announced the restoration of Constitution, which established the Second Constitutional Era. The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is ""Middle-Eastern"" and the derived noun is ""Middle-Easterner"". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is an Arab sovereign state in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula. With a land area of approximately , Saudi Arabia is geographically the fifth-largest state in Asia and second-largest state in the Arab world after Algeria. Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms. The First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire was the period of constitutional monarchy from the promulgation of the ""Kanûn- Esâsî"" (meaning ""Basic Law"" or ""Fundamental Law"" in Ottoman Turkish), written by members of the Young Ottomans, on 23 November 1876 until 13 February 1878. These Young Ottomans were dissatisfied by the Tanzimat and instead pushed for a constitutional government similar to that in Europe. The constitutional period started with the dethroning of Sultan Abdülaziz. Abdulhamid II took his place as Sultan. The era ended with the suspension of the Ottoman parliament and the constitution by sultan Abdülhamid II, with which he restored his own absolute monarchy. The Balkan Peninsula, or the Balkans, is a peninsula and a cultural area in Eastern and Southeastern Europe with various and disputed borders. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbia-Bulgaria border to the Black Sea. The Gulf of Aqaba (""Khalij al-Aqabah"") or Gulf of Eilat (""Mifrats Eilat"") is a large gulf at the northern tip of the Red Sea, east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian mainland. Its coastline is divided between four countries: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. Armenia ( tr. ""Hayastan""), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. ""Hayastani Hanrapetutyun""), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the ""Armenian Highlands"", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south."

Hell, in many mythological, folklore and religious traditions, is a place of torment and punishment in an afterlife. It is viewed by most Abrahamic traditions as punishment. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as eternal destinations. Religions with a cyclic history often depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations. Typically these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the Earth's surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include Heaven, Purgatory, Paradise, and Limbo. The afterlife (also referred to as life after death or the hereafter) is the concept of a realm, or the realm itself (whether physical or transcendental), in which an essential part of an individual's identity or consciousness continues to exist after the death of the body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire soul or spirit, of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian nirvana. Belief in an afterlife, which may be naturalistic or supernatural, is in contrast to the belief in oblivion after death.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.

19,What is the country of citizenship of Mattia Gavazzi?,italy,"['argentina', 'brazil', 'colombia', 'ecuador', 'france', 'italy', 'peru', 'switzerland', 'united kingdom']"," Aigle, a historic town in Switzerland, is the capital of the district of Aigle in the canton of Vaud. It is also the location of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body for international cycling competitions. The Tour de San Luis, a road cycling race held in Argentina, is part of the UCI America Tour. The race features an individual time trial and six stages, and is rated 2.1 by the UCI.

Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is a hormone and neurotransmitter that functions in the brain and body. It is produced in the kidneys and affects various parts of the body. The UCI, based in Aigle, oversees international cycling events, including the Tour de San Luis.

Mattia Gavazzi, an Italian road cyclist, competed in the Tour de San Luis in 2013 after a suspension for cocaine use. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that affects the brain's reward pathway, leading to addiction. It is made from the leaves of the coca plant, which are grown in South America. The illegal market for cocaine is estimated to be between 100 and 500 billion USD annually.

Cocaine use is a significant global issue, with between 14 and 21 million people using the drug each year. The highest usage rates are in North America, followed by Europe and South America. Cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths in 2013, up from 2,400 in 1990. The coca plant has been used by Peruvians for centuries, and cocaine was first isolated from its leaves in 1860. Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to criminalize recreational cocaine use. ","Aigle (French for ""eagle"") is a historic town and a municipality and the capital of the district of Aigle in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. The Tour de San Luis is a road cycling race held in San Luis Province, Argentina. The race consists of a competition over an individual time trial, and six stages. The competition carries a UCI rating of 2.1, and is part of the UCI America Tour, which is one of five UCI Continental Circuits sponsored by the Union Cycliste Internationale, the sport's international governing body. South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). Norepinephrine (NE), also called noradrenaline (NA) or noradrenalin, is an organic chemical in the catecholamine family that functions in the brain and body as a hormone and neurotransmitter. The name ""noradrenaline,"" derived from Latin roots meaning ""at/alongside the kidneys,"" is more commonly used in the United Kingdom; in the United States, ""norepinephrine,"" derived from Greek roots having that same meaning, is usually preferred. ""Norepinephrine"" is also the international nonproprietary name given to the drug. Regardless of which name is used for the substance itself, parts of the body that produce or are affected by it are referred to as noradrenergic. The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland. Peruvians are the citizens of the Republic of Peru or their descendants abroad. Peru is a multiethnic country formed by the combination of different groups over five centuries, so people in Peru usually treat their nationality as a citizenship rather than an ethnicity. Amerindians inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before Spanish Conquest in the 16th century; according to historian David N. Cook their population decreased from an estimated 59 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of infectious diseases. Spaniards and Africans arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and with indigenous peoples. During the Republic, there has been a gradual immigration of European people (specially from Spain and Italy, and in a less extent from France, the Balkans, Great Britain and Germany). Japanese and Chinese arrived in large numbers at the end of nineteenth century. Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. Mattia Gavazzi ( born 14 June 1983 ) is an Italian road cyclist , who rides as a member of the Danish cycling team Christina Watches - Dana . In April 2010 , Gavazzi was suspended by the Union Cycliste Internationale following a positive doping control for cocaine . He made his comeback in the Tour de San Luis in 2013 . He is a specialist sprinter . Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.
Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.
Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the bloodbrain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the ""coca"" plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year. With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.
After cannabis, cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life. In 2013 cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. The leaves of the ""coca"" plant have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime."

They became famous during the early Classical Hollywood era of American cinema, known for their slapstick comedy. Their signature tune, ""The Cuckoo Song,"" played over the opening credits of their films.

The term ""public opinion"" refers to the collective opinion of the people on an issue or problem. It has been considered important in politics since the 17th century.

The bowler hat, also known as a bob hat, bombín, or derby, is a hard felt hat with a rounded crown. It was created in 1849 and became popular with the working classes in the 19th century.

Oliver Hardy, born Oliver Norvell ""Babe"" Hardy, was an American comic actor famous as one-half of Laurel and Hardy. He appeared with his comedy partner Stan Laurel in 107 films, feature films, and cameo roles.

A featurette is a film usually of three reels in length, or about 2440 minutes in running time. It is longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. The term was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s.

Comedy is a discourse or work intended to be humorous or amusing, often inducing laughter. The origins of the term can be traced back to Ancient Greece, where comic poets performed political satire at the theaters. The essential agon of comedy is a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes.

""Outwitting Dad"" is a 1914 American comedy film that features Oliver Hardy's first onscreen appearance. ""Sailors, Beware!"" is a silent comedy short film starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy prior to their official billing as the duo Laurel and Hardy. They appeared in a total of 107 films between 1921 and 1951. ","A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film. Although no consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as ""an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits"". The term featurette originally applied to a film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film. Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. Laurel and Hardy were a comedy double act during the early Classical Hollywood era of American cinema. The team was composed of thin Englishman Stan Laurel (18901965) and heavyset American Oliver Hardy (18921957). They became well known during the late 1920s through the mid-1940s for their slapstick comedy, with Laurel playing the clumsy and childlike friend of the pompous Hardy. The duo's signature tune is known variously as ""The Cuckoo Song"", ""Ku-Ku"", or ""The Dance of the Cuckoos"". It was played over the opening credits of their films and has become as emblematic of the duo as their bowler hats. The desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people  or the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem  is called public opinion. 
The English term ""public opinion"" dates back to the seventeenth century work by John Locke, ""An Essay Concerning Human Understanding"", which contains an early consideration of the importance of public opinion in the ordering of politics. The term was derived from the French word ""l'opinion"", which was first used in 1588 by Michel de Montaigne. The bowler hat, also known as a bob hat, bombín or derby (USA), is a hard felt hat with a rounded crown, created originally during 1849. The bowler, a protective and durable hat style, was popular with the British and American working classes during the remaining 19th century, and later with the middle and upper classes in the United Kingdom and the eastern United States. Oliver Norvell ""Babe"" Hardy (born Norvell Hardy; January 18, 1892  August 7, 1957) was an American comic actor famous as one-half of Laurel and Hardy, the classic double act that began in the era of silent films and lasted 25 years, from 1927 to 1951. He appeared with his comedy partner Stan Laurel in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles. He was credited with his first film, ""Outwitting Dad"", in 1914. In some of his early works, he was billed as ""Babe Hardy"", using his nickname. Featurette is a term used in the American film industry to designate a film usually of three reels in length, or about 2440 minutes in running time, thus longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. Hence, it is a ""small feature"" (the ending ""-ette"" is a common diminutive suffix derived from French). The term was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s, when films of such length as the Hal Roach's Streamlinersand several French films of that lengthceased being made, or were made as experimental or art films and subsumed under the more general rubric of short. Its use outside the USA is unknown, although it was as commonly applied to foreign imports as to domestic productions within that country. In a modern sense, comedy (from the , ""kmidía"") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old"". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

Boats are distinguished from ships based on size, shape, and cargo or passenger capacity. Aircraft, on the other hand, are machines that fly by gaining support from the air, using static lift or dynamic lift from airfoils or jet engines. Aircraft carriers are warships that serve as seagoing airbases, equipped with facilities for deploying and recovering aircraft. Naval warfare involves combat in and on the sea, ocean, or other major bodies of water. A propeller is a type of fan that transmits power by converting rotational motion into thrust, while a pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blade. Marine propellers, also known as screw propellers, are characterized by their high propulsive efficiency and ability to throw thrust in any direction at any time. Steamboats are boats propelled primarily by steam power, using either propellers or paddlewheels. The United States Armed Forces consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, with the President of the United States as the military's overall head. The National Security Act of 1947 created the modern U.S. military framework, merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment, headed by the Secretary of Defense. The United States has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10 of the United States Code. A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels that are fully equipped for service but not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. Steamships are ocean-faring vessels propelled by steam engines that typically drive propellers or paddlewheels. The United States Navy is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces, with the largest combined battle fleet tonnage in the world. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service. The third USS Vixen was a steamboat in the United States Navy during the Mexican-American War. ","A boat is a watercraft of a large range of sizes designed to float, plane, work or travel on water. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways (e.g., rivers and lakes) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation from a ship in an offshore environment. In naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters long on the Great Lakes are called oreboats. For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as 'boats' rather than 'ships', regardless of their size and shape. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity.  An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.  Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. A propeller is a type of fan that transmits power by converting rotational motion into thrust. A pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blade, and a fluid (such as air or water) is accelerated behind the blade. Propeller dynamics, like those of aircraft wings, can be modelled by either or both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law. A marine propeller of this type is sometimes colloquially known as a screw propeller or screw, however there is a different class of propellers known as cycloidal propellers - they are characterized by the higher propulsive efficiency averaging 0.72 compared to the screw propellers average of 0.6 and the ability to throw thrust in any direction at any time. Their disadvantages are higher mechanical complexity and higher cost. A steamboat is a boat that is propelled primarily by steam power, typically driving propellers or paddlewheels. Steamboats sometimes use the prefix designation SS, S.S. or S/S (for 'Screw Steamer') or PS (for 'Paddle Steamer'), however these designations are most often used for Steamships. The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.
From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be ""in mothballs"" or ""mothballed""; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is ""ghost fleet"". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be ""laid up in ordinary"". A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is an ocean faring seaworthy vessel that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically drive (turn) propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s; however, there were exceptions that came before. Steamships usually use the prefix designations of ""PS"" for ""paddle steamer"" or ""SS"" for ""screw steamer"" (using a propeller or screw). As paddle steamers became less common, ""SS"" is assumed by many to stand for ""steam ship"". Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as ""MV"" for ""motor vessel"", so it is not correct to use ""SS"" for most modern vessels. The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .

","Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the ""color"" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (""mousike""; ""art of the Muses""). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as ""the harmony of the spheres"" and ""it is music to my ears"" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no noise, only sound.""

Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic or digital equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from ""white goods"" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.

The New Testament, a significant part of Christian scripture, discusses Jesus' teachings and his relationship with Mary Magdalene. The Old Testament, the first section of the Christian Bible, is based on the Hebrew Bible and varies in canon among different Christian Churches.

Mary Magdalene, a key figure in Christianity, is said to have been a follower of Jesus and witnessed his crucifixion and resurrection. She is mentioned at least 12 times in the four Gospels, more than most of the apostles.

Music, an art form and cultural activity, uses sound and silence, and its common elements include pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and timbre. It can be performed with various instruments and vocal techniques, and its definition varies among ancient Greek and Indian philosophers.

Vivian Stanshall, an English musician, songwriter, and author, is best known for his work with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and his exploration of the British upper classes in ""Sir Henry at Rawlinson End."" He was also the widow of Ki Longfellow, an American novelist and playwright known for her novel ""The Secret Magdalene.""

","Magdala (Aramaic:  / ""Magdala"", meaning ""elegant"", ""great"", or ""tower"" (viz. ""great place""); Hebrew:  / ""Migdal"", meaning ""tower""; Arabic:   / ""Qariyat al-Majdal"") is the name of at least two places in Galilee, mentioned in the Jewish ""Talmud"" and one place that may be mentioned in the Christian ""New Testament"". The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , ""H Kain Diathk"") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the ""Tanakh"", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). The Secret Magdalene , American Ki Longfellow 's third book , was published in 2005 . The historical novel challenges the traditional view of events chronicled in the New Testament , specifically the ministry of Jesus Christ and his relationship to Mary Magdalene . It is told entirely in the first - person voice of Mariamne . A hardback edition was published by Random House in 2006 , followed by a trade paperback edition published by Three Rivers Press , a Random House imprint , in December 2007 . It has been translated into several languages , including Spanish , Czech , Chinese , French and Icelandic . It is a tale of Mariamne 's quest to understand the gnosis she experienced as a child . Longfellow said she based the book on her studies of translations of historic Jewish and Arabic texts , as well as on modern Biblical scholarship . A selected bibliography is included . Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root ""literatura""/""litteratura"" (derived itself from ""littera"": ""letter"" or ""handwriting"") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books. Mary Magdalene (, original Biblical ), literally translated as Mary the Magdalene or Mary of Magdala, is a figure in Christianity who, according to the Bible, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers.

Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).

The President of the United States serves as the military's overall head, working with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to formulate military policy.

The military has played a significant role in the history of the United States, with victories in the First and Second Barbary Wars fostering a sense of national unity and identity. However, the Founders were wary of a permanent military force. The military was crucial during the American Civil War, with many leading generals being selected from its ranks. It wasn't until World War II that a large standing army was officially established.

The National Security Act of 1947, adopted during the Cold War's onset, established the modern U.S. military framework. The Act merged the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment, which was later renamed the Department of Defense in 1949. The Act also created the Department of the Air Force and the National Security Council.

The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. It is the largest and most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The USN has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. It has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve, with 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service.

The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.
From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established.

40,What is the term for 'pars pro toto' in the given options?,phrase,"['alphabet', 'behavior', 'bengali', 'branch', 'butter', 'century', 'change', 'collective', 'complex', 'concept', 'emphasis', 'family', 'figure of speech', 'language', 'language family', 'law', 'legislature', 'limited', 'may', 'metonymy', 'name', 'part', 'phrase', 'population', 'process', 'race', 'rat', 'representative', 'running', 'science', 'script', 'single', 'speech', 'state', 'suffix', 'system', 'term', 'tradition', 'understanding', 'vice', 'word', 'writing']"," The Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, originated from the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was in turn derived from the Phoenician abjad and Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans, who ruled early Rome, adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet, which evolved into the Etruscan alphabet and then the Latin alphabet used by the Romans.

Pars pro toto is a figure of speech where a part of something is used to represent the whole, while totum pro parte is the inverse, where the whole is used to describe a part. Examples of pars pro toto include ""England"" for the United Kingdom, ""Russia"" for the former Soviet Union, and ""Holland"" for the Netherlands.

The Indo-European languages are a family of several hundred related languages and dialects, with about 445 living languages. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian, and Punjabi.

In law, a merism is a figure of speech that refers to a single thing by enumerating its parts, while a synecdoche is a figure of speech where a term for a part of something refers to the whole or vice versa.

The Greek alphabet, used to write the Greek language, was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels and consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts and serves as a source of technical symbols in mathematics, science, and other fields.

A word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content. It may consist of a single morpheme or several, and can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases, clauses, and sentences.

Figures of speech are rhetorical devices that use figurative language to create emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, they can also introduce ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretations. ","The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is called not by its own name but rather by a metonym, the name of something associated in meaning with that thing or concept. The words ""metonymy"" and ""metonym"" come from the , , ""a change of name"", from , , ""after, beyond"" and , , a suffix used to name figures of speech, from , or , , ""name"". Pars pro toto , Latin for `` a part ( taken ) for the whole '' , is a figure of speech where the name of a portion of an object , place , or concept represents its entirety . It is distinct from a merism , which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts ; metonymy , where an object , place , or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object , place , or concept ; or synecdoche , which can refer both to this and its inverse of the whole representing a part . In the context of language , pars pro toto means that something is named after a part of it , or after a limited characteristic , in itself not necessarily representative for the whole . For example , `` glasses '' is a pars pro toto name for something that consists of more than just two pieces of glass . Pars pro toto is a common device in iconography , where a particular icon can stand for a complete set of characteristics . James George Frazer used `` pars pro toto '' to explain his concept of contagious magic . Examples of common pars pro toto usage in political geography include `` Russia '' or `` Russians '' , for the entire former Russian Empire or former Soviet Union or its people , Taiwan or Taipei ( `` Chinese Taipei '' ) for Republic of China , Holland for the Netherlands , and , particularly in languages other than English , using the translation of `` England '' in that language for `` United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland '' . Among English - speakers `` Great Britain '' is a common pars pro toto shorthand for the entire United Kingdom . Switzerland 's name ( in German Schweiz ) comes from its central Canton of Schwyz . The inverse of a pars pro toto is a totum pro parte , in which the whole is used to describe a part , such as widespread use of `` America '' ( which originally named the entire western hemisphere to place it geographically , with alliteration , alongside Asia , Africa , `` Europa , '' and ultimately Arctica , Antarctica and Australia ) in place of `` United States of America '' , `` United States '' or `` USA '' . The term synecdoche is used for both , as well as similar metaphors , though in Greek it literally means `` simultaneous understanding '' . Pars pro toto ( and totum pro parte ) can be imprecise , controversial or even offensive . In the UK , for instance , substituting `` Great Britain '' or using the terms `` British '' or `` English '' for countries or provinces ( that choice of terms is a point of contention all its own ) which are neither British nor English can be a hot button issue and divide along sectarian lines , from a grand political perspective down to an individual level of personal preference of how one wishes to self - identify . In Northern Ireland especially , many Unionists may wish to be referred to as British or even English and may prefer to call the region Ulster , whereas Irish Republicans are not offended by the `` Irish '' identifier but may well take umbrage to being called English or referring to an incomplete Ulster or declare it part of Britain when referring to the province to emphasize its subjugation and divided nature . The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by ""Ethnologue"", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family. In law, a merism is a figure of speech by which a single thing is referred to by a conventional phrase that enumerates several of its parts, ""or"" which lists several synonyms for the same thing. A synecdoche (; from Greek , ""synekdoche"", . ""simultaneous understanding"") is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole of something or vice versa. A synecdoche is a class of metonymy, often by means of either mentioning a part for the whole or conversely the whole for one of its parts. Examples from common English expressions include ""bread and butter"" (for ""livelihood""), ""suits"" (for ""businesspeople""), and ""boots"" (for ""soldiers"") (Pars pro toto), or conversely ""America"" (for ""the United States of America"") (Totum pro parte).  Totum pro parte is Latin for ""the whole for a part""; it refers to a kind of synecdoche. The plural is tota pro partibus, ""wholes for parts"". When used in a context of language it means that something is named after something of which it is only a part (or only a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole). A ""pars pro toto"" (in which a part is used to describe the whole) is the opposite of a ""totum pro parte"". A classical language is a language with a literature that is ""classical"". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, ""it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature."" Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: ""oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect""), or several (""rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected""), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are ""-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed"").
A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (""rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed""), or more than one root in a compound (""black-board, rat-race""). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (""a red rock""), clauses (""I threw a rock""), and sentences (""He threw a rock too, but he missed""). A figure of speech or rhetorical figure is figurative language in the form of a single word or phrase. It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words. Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as any figure of speech introduces an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation. Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets."

The Franciscan Order includes the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. These orders follow the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder and his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary.

Felix of Cantalice, born in 1515 in Italy, was the first Capuchin friar to be canonized as a saint by Pope Clement XI in 1712. The Capuchin friars are a branch of the Franciscan Order, and their charism is based on the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder, Saint Francis of Assisi.

In summary, the Carmelites, Franciscans, and Capuchin friars are all significant orders of friars within the Catholic Church, each with their unique charism and spiritual disciplines. These orders have been influential in shaping the religious landscape of the Church and continue to play a vital role in the lives of their members and the communities they serve. ","A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. The Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel by synecdoche) is a Roman Catholic religious order founded, probably in the 12th century, on Mount Carmel in the Crusader States, hence the name Carmelites. However, historical records about its origin remain uncertain. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived, and this is likely to be a later extrapolation by hagiographers. The term Augustinians, named after Augustine of Hippo (354430), applies to two separate types of Catholic religious orders and some Anglican religious orders. Within Anglicanism the Rule of St Augustine is followed only by women, who form several different communities of Augustinian nuns in the Anglican Communion. Within Roman Catholicism Augustinians may be members of either one of two separate and distinct types of Order:
Charism.
In a religious community, ""charism"" is the particular contribution that each religious order, congregation or family and its individual members embody. The teaching and writing of Augustine, the Augustinian Rule, and the lives and experiences of Augustinians over sixteen centuries help define the ethos of the order. The Franciscans are a group of related mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi. These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. Theses orders adheres to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary, among many others.  Felix of Cantalice , O.F.M. Cap . ( Italian : Felice da Cantalice ) , was born on 18 May 1515 to peasant parents in Cantalice , Italy , in the central Italian region of Lazio . Canonized by Pope Clement XI in 1712 , he was the first Capuchin friar to be named a saint ."

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. Inuinnaqtun (natively meaning ""like the real human beings/peoples""), is an indigenous Inuit language of Canada and a dialect of Inuvialuktun. It is related very closely to Inuktitut, and some scholars, such as Richard Condon, believe that Inuinnaqtun is more appropriately classified as a dialect of Inuktitut. The governments of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut recognise Inuinnaqtun as an official language in addition to Inuktitut. The Official Languages Act of Nunavut, passed by the Senate of Canada on June 11, 2009, recognized Inuinnaqtun as one of the official languages of Nunavut."

A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics.

Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny. The uterus, also known as the womb, is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ in humans and most other mammals. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. The nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils and is responsible for respiration. Altricial species are those whose young are incapable of moving around on their own soon after birth or hatching. Mammals are vertebrates with specific characteristics such as a neocortex, hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands. The skeleton provides support and protection to the body, while muscles enable movement and maintain posture. Joints connect bones and allow for movement. Birth, or parturition, is the process of bringing forth offspring, which in mammals is initiated by hormones. Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside the female's uterus. Cartilage is a resilient tissue that forms a part of the skeletal system. Hormones are signaling molecules that regulate physiology and behavior. White blood cells are involved in protecting the body against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. Bones are rigid organs that constitute part of the vertebrate skeleton, providing support, protection, and enabling movement. The ear is the organ of hearing and balance in mammals. Marsupials are mammals with distinctive characteristics, including carrying their young in a pouch. Precocial species are those whose young are relatively mature and mobile from birth or hatching. Atelosteogenesis, type II, is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development. ","In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee. The uterus (from Latin ""uterus"", plural ""uteri"") or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of humans and most other mammals. In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other end, the fundus, is connected to the fallopian tubes. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. In the embryo the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus. The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus. Anatomically, a nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils, or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside the mouth. Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants. On most other mammals, it is located on the upper tip of the snout. Altricial, meaning ""requiring nourishment"", refers to a pattern of growth and development in organisms which are incapable of moving around on their own soon after hatching or being born. The word is derived from the Latin root ""alere"" meaning ""to nurse, to rear, or to nourish"" and refers to the need for young to be fed and taken care of for a long duration. Species whose young are immediately or quickly mobile are known as precocial. Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin ""mamma"" ""breast""), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct ""Haldanodon."" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. Their role as shock absorbers in the spine is crucial. The rib cage is an arrangement of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs. In humans, the rib cage, also known as the thoracic cage, is a bony and cartilaginous structure which surrounds the thoracic cavity and supports the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle), forming a core portion of the human skeleton. A typical human rib cage consists of 24 ribs, the sternum (with xiphoid process), costal cartilages, and the 12 thoracic vertebrae. Together with the skin and associated fascia and muscles, the rib cage makes up the thoracic wall and provides attachments for the muscles of the neck, thorax, upper abdomen, and back. Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis. The skeleton (from Greek , ""skeletós"" ""dried up"") is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an organism. There are several different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body, the hydroskeleton, and the cytoskeleton. A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy. Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.  A joint or articulation (or articular surface) is the connection made between bones in the body which link the skeletal system into a functional whole. They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, and are able to withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) in order to protect the brain and the sense organs. The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a fibrous joint known as a gomphosis. Joints are classified both structurally and functionally. Birth, also known as parturition, is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's pouch. Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside female viviparous animals. It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals. Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time (multiple gestations). Cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic tissue, rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible than muscle. A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All white blood cells are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system. A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions.  The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word ""ear"" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation. Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka. Atelosteogenesis , type II is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development . It is extremely rare , and infants with the disorder are usually stillborn ; however , those who survive birth die soon after from respiratory failure . In biology, the term precocial refers to species in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching.

She is University Professor in the Department of English and of the Centre for Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto, where she has taught since 1988. In 2000 she was elected the 117th President of the Modern Language Association, the third Canadian to hold this position, and the first Canadian woman. She is particularly known for her influential theories of postmodernism. Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root ""literatura""/""litteratura"" (derived itself from ""littera"": ""letter"" or ""handwriting"") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). Gooflumps is the name given to a two - part parody series written in 1995 by Tom Hughes under the pseudonym of R. U. Slime . Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. Imitation (from Latin ""imitatio"", ""a copying, imitation"") is an advanced behavior whereby an individual observes and replicates another's behavior. Imitation is also a form of social learning that leads to the ""development of traditions, and ultimately our culture. It allows for the transfer of information (behaviours, customs, etc.) between individuals and down generations without the need for genetic inheritance."" The word ""imitation"" can be applied in many contexts, ranging from animal training to international politics. The term generally refers to conscious behavior; subconscious imitation is termed mirroring. A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. A parody (also called a spoof, send-up, take-off, or lampoon) is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original workits subject, author, style, or some other targetby means of satiric or ironic imitation. As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, ""parody  is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text."" Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as ""any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.""
Parody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music (although ""parody"" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation, gaming, and film."

Mencken. Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller. The first 6 issues of the Fortean Society's newsletter ""Doubt"" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser. Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues. Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society's direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean. During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of ""Doubt"" to espouse his politics. Particularly, he frequently expressed opposition to Civil Defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens. In contrast to the spirit of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed the atomic bomb as a hoax.

Theodore Herman Albert Dreiser (August 27, 1871  December 28, 1945) was an American novelist and journalist of the naturalist school. His novels often featured main characters who succeeded at their objectives despite a lack of a firm moral code, and literary situations that more closely resemble studies of nature than tales of choice and agency. Dreiser's best known novels include ""Sister Carrie"" (1900) and ""An American Tragedy"" (1925). In 1930 he was nominated to the Nobel Prize in Literature. Charles Hoy Fort (August 6, 1874  May 3, 1932) was an American writer and researcher who specialized in anomalous phenomena.

Biography.
Harry Clifford Pidgeon was born 31 August 1869 on a farm in Iowa. His father, Isaac Marion Pidgeon, was married 3 times and had a total of 12 children. The family were Quakers. At the age of 15, he set out for California where he found work on a ranch. Before long, he traveled north to Alaska, where he took a raft down the Yukon River and spent some time sailing among the small islands of the southeastern Alaskan coast. Later, he returned to California and traveled and worked in the Sierra Nevada mountains, taking up a career in photography. Sailing Alone Around the World is a sailing memoir by Joshua Slocum in 1900 about his single-handed global circumnavigation aboard the sloop ""Spray"". Slocum was the first person to sail around the world alone. The book was an immediate success and highly influential in inspiring later travelers. The Panama Canal is an artificial waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, above sea level, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo. Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait.

Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.

A sloop (from Dutch ""sloep"", in turn from French ""chaloupe"") is a sailing boat with a single mast and a fore-and-aft rig. A sloop has only one head-sail: if a vessel has two or more head-sails, the term 'cutter' is used, and its mast may be set further aft than on a sloop.  A yawl (from Dutch ""jol"") is a two-masted sailing craft similar to a sloop or cutter but with an additional mizzenmast (or mizzen mast) located well aft of the main mast, often right on the transom, or aft of the rudder post if the vessel has an inboard hung rudder. (A vessel with a larger mizzen located in a more forward position is called a ketch; see below: Yawl versus ketch.) The mizzen sail (smaller than the mainsail) is hoisted on the mizzen mast. Joshua Slocum (February 20, 1844  on or shortly after November 14, 1909) was the first man to sail single-handedly around the world. He was a Nova Scotian born, naturalised American seaman and adventurer, and a noted writer. In 1900 he wrote a book about his journey ""Sailing Alone Around the World"", which became an international best-seller. He disappeared in November 1909 while aboard his boat, the ""Spray"". A ketch is a sailing craft with two masts. The distinguishing characteristic of a ketch is that the forward of the two masts (the ""mainmast"") is larger than the after mast (the ""mizzen""). Historically the ketch was a square-rigged vessel, most commonly used as a freighter or fishing boat in northern Europe, particularly in the Baltic and North seas. In modern usage, the ketch is a fore-and-aft rigged vessel used as a yacht or pleasure craft."

","A mansard or mansard roof (also called a ""French roof"" or ""curb roof"") is a four-sided gambrel-style hip roof characterized by two slopes on each of its sides with the lower slope, punctured by dormer windows, at a steeper angle than the upper. The steep roof with windows creates an additional floor of habitable space (a garret), and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of habitable stories. The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building. Dougong is a unique structural element of interlocking wooden brackets, one of the most important elements in traditional Chinese architecture. A gambrel or gambrel roof is a usually symmetrical two-sided roof with two slopes on each side. (The usual architectural term in eighteenth-century England and America was ""Dutch roof."") The upper slope is positioned at a shallow angle, while the lower slope is steep. This design provides the advantages of a sloped roof while maximizing headroom inside the building's upper level and shortening what would otherwise be a tall roof. The name comes from the Medieval Latin word ""gamba"", meaning ""horse's hock or leg"". The term ""gambrel"" is of American origin, the older, European name being a curb (kerb, kirb) roof. Europeans historically did not distinguish between a gambrel roof and a mansard roof but called both types a mansard. In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves, Swedish ~, German ~, English ~ , French ~, or New England gambrel. Dutch Colonial is a style of domestic architecture , primarily characterized by gambrel roofs having curved eaves along the length of the house . Modern versions built in the early 20th century are more accurately referred to as `` Dutch Colonial Revival , '' a subtype of the Colonial Revival style . The eaves are the edges of the roof which overhang the face of a wall and, normally, project beyond the side of a building. The eaves form an overhang to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style; such as the Chinese dougong bracket systems. Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets."

The Danish West India Guinea Company annexed the uninhabited island of Saint Thomas in 1672 and St. John in 1675. In 1733, Saint Croix was purchased from the French West India Company. When the Company went bankrupt in 1755, the King of Denmark-Norway assumed direct control of the three islands. The Danish West Indies was occupied by Britain in 18011802 and 18071815, during the Napoleonic Wars. Frederick Joseph Ricketts (21 February 1881  15 May 1945) was an English composer of marches for band. Under the pen name Kenneth J.

The American Bandmasters Association (ABA) was formed in 1929 by Edwin Franko Goldman to promote concert band music. Goldman sought to raise esteem for concert bands among musicians and audiences.

The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.
From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. The French West India Company was a French trading company founded in 1664 by Jean-Baptiste Colbert and dissolved in 1674.

It was supposed to populate Canada, using the profits of the sugar economy that began in Guadeloupe. Its capital was six million pounds and its headquarters was in Le Havre.  The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare.

The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.  A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be ""in mothballs"" or ""mothballed""; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is ""ghost fleet"". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be ""laid up in ordinary"".

Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering.

The stadium has also been the venue for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals in 1983 and 1990, the UEFA Euro 1992 final, and the UEFA Cup final in 2004.

IFK Göteborg, a prominent Swedish football club, has played its home games at Ullevi since 2009. The club, founded in 1904, is the only Nordic country club to have won a pan-European competition, with victories in the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987. The club's colors, blue and white, are shared with the sports society Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna (IFK), from which the club originated.

Magnus Johansson, a former footballer for IFK Göteborg, Brann, and Västra Frölunda, is a notable figure in the club's history.

The new Gamla Ullevi Stadium, which opened in 2009, replaced the city's previous main football stadium. The construction of the new stadium was met with controversy due to its cost, the perceived low standard of the finished stadium, and the name of the stadium.

","The family Dipluridae, known as curtain-web spiders (or confusingly with other distantly related ones as funnel-web tarantulas) are a group of spiders in the infraorder Mygalomorphae, that have two pairs of booklungs, and chelicerae (fangs) that move up and down in a stabbing motion. A number of genera, including that of the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax""), used to be classified in this family but have now been moved to Hexathelidae. Atrax is a genus of venomous spiders found in Australia. It is a member of the subfamily Atracinae, the Australian funnel-web spiders, part of the Hexathelidae family. The genus was erected by the Reverend Octavius Pickard-Cambridge in 1877 for the species ""Atrax robustus"". 
, the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species: Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as ""tarantulas"". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. Atracinae, commonly known as Australian funnel-web spiders, is a subfamily of spiders in the funnel-web spider family Hexathelidae. All members of the subfamily are native to Australia. Atracinae consists of three genera: ""Atrax"", ""Hadronyche"", and ""Illawarra"", comprising 35 species. A number of the species produce venom which is dangerous to humans and bites by spiders of six of the species have caused severe injuries to victims. The bite of the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus"") is potentially deadly, but there have been no fatalities since the introduction of modern first aid techniques and antivenom. Venom is a form of toxin secreted by an animal for the purpose of causing harm to another.  The Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus"") is a species of venomous mygalomorph spider native to eastern Australia, usually found within a radius of Sydney. It is a member of a group of spiders known as Australian funnel-web spiders. Its bite is capable of causing serious injury or death in humans if left untreated. Hexathele hochstetteri , or the banded tunnelweb spider , is a large New Zealand spider in the family Hexathelidae . Despite its impressive size it is shy , and there are no records of these spiders biting humans . Hexathelidae is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea, and one of two families (along with Dipluridae) of spiders known as funnel-webs. This order is sometimes incorrectly referred to (in unknown references) as the venomous funnel-web tarantulas, due to the inclusion of the Australian funnel-web spiders, including the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus""). Most species in Hexathelidae are not dangerous to humans."

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person).
Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: ""The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms."" He concluded: ""Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country."" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.
In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.
Violence in many forms is preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors such as concentrated poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be effective in preventing violence. The Sea of Azov (""Azovs'ke more/Azovke more"") is a sea in Eastern Europe. To the south it is linked by the narrow (about ) Strait of Kerch to the Black Sea, and it is sometimes regarded as a northern extension of the Black Sea. The sea is bounded in the north by mainland Ukraine, in the east by Russia, and in the west by the Crimean Peninsula. The Don and Kuban are the major rivers that flow into it. The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world, with the depth varying between . There is a constant outflow of water from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. The Crimean Peninsula (""Krymskiy poluostrov;"" , ""Kryms'ky pivostriv""), also known simply as Crimea ( ""Krym"" ""Krym""), is a major land mass on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast. The peninsula is located south of the Ukrainian region of Kherson and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are ""almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region"". A related United Nations paper adds that ""every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct"". Belarus ( lat.

Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . Satyagraha It was a movement started by Gandhiji.(""satygraha"")  loosely translated as ""insistence on truth"" (""satya"" ""truth""; ""agraha"" ""insistence"" or ""holding firmly to"") or ""holding onto truth"" or ""truth force""  is a particular form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. The term ""satyagraha"" was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi (18691948). He deployed satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced Martin Luther King, Jr.'s and James Bevel's campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States (19541968), and many other social justice and similar movements.

In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the ""goal crease"" (often referred to simply as "" the crease"" or ""the net""). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs.

Choreography is the art or practice of designing sequences of movements of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which motion, form, or both are specified. ""Choreography"" may also refer to the design itself. A choreographer is one who creates choreographies by practicing the art of choreography, a process known as ""choreographing"". Choreography is used in a variety of fields, including musical theater, cheerleading, cinematography, gymnastics, fashion shows, ice skating, marching band, show choir, theatre, synchronized swimming, cardistry, video game production and animated art. In the performing arts, choreography applies to human movement and form. In dance, choreography is also known as dance choreography or ""dance composition"".

Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work. A performance, in the performing arts, generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. Usually the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand. Afterwards audience members often applaud."

","In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 (zero) and 1 (one). The base-2 system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices. Each digit is referred to as a bit. Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be ""text-only"", however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as ""Puzzle-free"", that focuses on narrative, and ""text adventures"" that focus on puzzles. The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. Magnetic Scrolls was a British video game developer active between 1984 and 1990. A pioneer of audiovisually elaborate text adventure games, it was one of the two largest and most acclaimed interactive fiction developers of the 1980s. The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term ""bit"" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit ""shannon"", named after Claude Shannon. The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987. A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word ""video"" in ""video game"" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. Range for storing integers.
A 32-bit register can store 2 different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 4,294,967,295 (2 - 1) for representation as an (unsigned) binary number, and -2,147,483,648 (-2) through 2,147,483,647 (2 - 1) for representation as two's complement. The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977. The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations. Jinxter is a text adventure video game developed by Magnetic Scrolls and published by Rainbird in 1987 for popular 8 - bit and 16 - bit machines of the time as well as for the 32 - bit Acorn Archimedes . Jinxter tells the story of a man on a mission to save the fictional land of Aquitania from the looming threat of evil witches . The game was well received by critics upon its release . In computing, memory address is a data concept used at various levels by software and hardware to access the computer's primary storage memory. Memory addresses are fixed-length sequences of digits conventionally displayed and manipulated as unsigned integers. Such numerical semantic bases itself upon features of CPU (such as the instruction pointer and incremental address registers), as well upon use of the memory like an array endorsed by various programming languages. Two's complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, as well as a binary signed number representation based on this operation. Its wide use in computing makes it the most important example of a radix complement. ARM, originally Acorn RISC Machine, later Advanced RISC Machine, is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments. British company ARM Holdings develops the architecture and licenses it to other companies, who design their own products that implement one of those architecturesincluding systems-on-chips (SoC) that incorporate memory, interfaces, radios, etc. It also designs cores that implement this instruction set and licenses these designs to a number of companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products. The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.
The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. The ""de facto"" standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte. The international standard IEC 80000-13 codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the 8-bit size."

","This list includes the Roman names of countries , or significant regions , known to the Roman Empire . The Battle of Actium was the decisive confrontation of the Final War of the Roman Republic, a naval engagement between Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra on 2 September 31 BC, on the Ionian Sea near the promontory of Actium, in the Roman province of Epirus Vetus in Greece. Octavian's fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, while Antony's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt. Marcus Antonius (Latin: ; January 14, August 1, 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire. The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. Rome is a city and special ""comune"" (named ""Roma Capitale"") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated ""comune"" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.  The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title ""Augustus"", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC  15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. An emperor (through Old French ""empereor"" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (""empress consort""), mother (""empress dowager""), or a woman who rules in her own right (""empress regnant""). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as ""Emperor"". Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. The Roman Senate was a political institution in ancient Rome. It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the city (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC, the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries. Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight
above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures."

Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a ""single effect"" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. Kirsty Cotton is a fictional character from the ""Hellraiser"" series of films. Created by writer Clive Barker, she first appears in the 1987 film ""Hellraiser"" and is based upon the character of the same name from the novel ""The Hellbound Heart"". The character is usually regarded as the protagonist in the ""Hellraiser"" films. In all her appearances in the film series, she was portrayed by actress Ashley Laurence. The film describes her as being Larry Cotton's daughter while in the novel, she is simply a friend of his. Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. Books of Blood are a series of horror fiction collections written by the British author Clive Barker. Clive Barker (born 5 October 1952) is an English writer, film director, and visual artist best known for his work in both fantasy and horror fiction. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, the ""Books of Blood"", which established him as a leading horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the ""Hellraiser"" and ""Candyman"" series. He was the Executive Producer of the film ""Gods and Monsters"". A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. An American comic book is a thin (typically 32-page) periodical containing primarily comics content. A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ""Famous Funnies"", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term ""comic book"" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. The Hellbound Heart is a horror novella by Clive Barker, first published in November 1986 by Dark Harvest in the third volume of their ""Night Visions"" anthology series, and notable for becoming the basis for the 1987 movie ""Hellraiser"" and its franchise. It was re-released as a stand-alone title by HarperCollins in 1988, after the success of the movie, along with an audiobook recorded by Clive Barker and published by Simon & Schuster Audioworks. It retains the gory, visceral style that Barker introduced in his series of collected short stories ""The Books of Blood"". The story focuses on a mystical puzzle box and the horror it wreaks on a family that is unfortunate enough to come across it. Ashley Laurence (born May 28, 1966) is an American actress and artist. She is best known for her role as Kirsty Cotton in Clive Barker's quintessential horror classic: ""Hellraiser"" (1987) and its sequels """" (1988), """" (1992) and """" (2002). She is also known for her roles in ""Lightning Bug"" (2004) and ""Red"" (2008). She has been featured in several national advertising campaigns for Geico, Coors Lite, AT&T. An audiobook (or talking book) is a recording of a text being read. A reading of the complete text is noted as ""unabridged"", while readings of a reduced version, or abridgement of the text are labeled as ""abridged"". A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics.
There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes."

The President of the United States serves as the military's overall head, working with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to formulate military policy.

The military has played a significant role in the history of the United States, with victories in the First and Second Barbary Wars fostering a sense of national unity and identity. However, the Founders were wary of a permanent military force. The military was crucial during the American Civil War, with many leading generals being selected from its ranks. It wasn't until World War II that a large standing army was officially established.

The National Security Act of 1947, adopted during the Cold War's onset, established the modern U.S. military framework. The Act merged the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment, which was later renamed the Department of Defense in 1949. The Act also created the Department of the Air Force and the National Security Council.

The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. It is the largest and most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage.

","The United East Indian Company (or Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie in modern spelling; VOC), referred to by the British as the Dutch East India Company, was originally established as a chartered company in 1602, when the Dutch government granted it a 21-year monopoly on the Dutch spice trade. It is often considered to have been the first multinational corporation in the world, and it was the first company to issue stock. The largest and most valuable corporation in history, it possessed quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. A carrack or naus was a three- or four-masted ocean-going sailing ship and was developed in the 14th and 15th centuries in Europe.

A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of ""possibility"", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.

Currently the new town centre is being built, working title ""Bruisend Dorpshart"" (Sparkling Village's Heart). Kaatsheuvel is (internationally) well known for the Efteling theme park and a gateway to National Park Loonse en Drunense Duinen. A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the ""Russian mountains"" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more ""inversions"" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars. Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics."

Mesopotamia, corresponding to modern-day Iraq, Syria, and parts of Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, is known for its rich history and the birthplace of monasticism in Asia. The first cenobitic monastery in Mesopotamia was founded by Mar Awgin in the 4th century AD.

Monasteries are buildings or complexes where monks or nuns live and work. Monks are individuals who dedicate their lives to religious asceticism, either alone or with others. Nuns are women who live in religious communities, typically under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

Temples are structures reserved for religious or spiritual rituals and activities, such as prayer and sacrifice. They are used in various faiths, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

Iraq, officially known as the Republic of Iraq, is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria.

They are composed of monomers, which are nucleotides made of three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is a simple ribose, the polymer is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Dynamite is an explosive made of nitroglycerin, sorbents (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the Swedish chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel in Geesthacht, and patented in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safer alternative to gun powder and nitroglycerin. Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin ""medicus"", meaning ""a physician"". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans. Graphite, archaically referred to as plumbago, is a crystalline form of carbon, a semimetal, a native element mineral, and one of the allotropes of carbon. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation of carbon compounds. A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term ""molecule"" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. Francis Harry Compton Crick (8 June 1916  28 July 2004) was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist, most noted for being a co-discoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule in 1953 with James Watson. Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins, he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material"". Raymond G. Gosling (15 July 1926  18 May 2015) was a British scientist who deduced the structure of DNA with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King's College, London. The Nobel Foundation is a private institution founded on 29 June 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The Foundation is based on the last will of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal. Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins (15 December 1916  5 October 2004) was a New Zealand-born British physicist and molecular biologist, and Nobel laureate whose research contributed to the scientific understanding of phosphorescence, isotope separation, optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and to the development of radar. He is best known for his work at King's College London on the structure of DNA. X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it ""X-radiation"" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of ""X-ray(s)"" in the English language includes the variants ""x-ray(s)"", ""xray(s)"", and ""X ray(s)"". Alfred Bernhard Nobel (21 October 1833  10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. Alexander ( Alec ) Rawson Stokes ( 27 June 1919 -- 5 February 2003 ) was a co-author of the second of the three papers published sequentially in Nature on 25 April 1953 announcing the presumed molecular structure of DNA . The first was authored by Francis Crick and James Watson , and the third by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling . The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1962 to Crick , Watson and Wilkins for this work . In 1993 , on the 40th anniversary of the publication of the molecular structure of DNA , a plaque was erected in the Quad ( courtyard ) of the Strand campus of King 's College London commemorating the contributions of Franklin , Gosling , Stokes , Wilson and Wilkins to DNA X-ray diffraction studies . Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome. A diploma (from Greek µ ""díplma"", meaning ""folded paper"") is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as a college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study, or (US) recording that an academic degree has been awarded. In some countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Australia, the word diploma also refers to an academic award (e.g. diploma of higher education, graduate diploma, postgraduate diploma). Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document, thus diplomatic, diplomat and diplomacy via the ""Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus"". James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin. Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material"". Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 192016 April 1958) was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognized posthumously. The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: ""Nobelpriset"") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances."

Motherhead Bug was a rock music group founded in 1989 in New York City by singer and trombone player David Ouimet and bass guitarist Tony Lee. The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as ""rock and roll"" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.

The Carmelites are one of the significant orders of friars, alongside the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, and Carmelites. The term ""charism"" refers to the unique contribution of each religious order, which in the case of the Carmelites, is defined by the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder, Augustine of Hippo.

The Franciscan Order, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi, is another prominent group of mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church. The Franciscan Order includes the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. These orders follow the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder and his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary.

Felix of Cantalice, born in 1515 in Italy, was the first Capuchin friar to be canonized as a saint by Pope Clement XI in 1712. The Capuchin friars are a branch of the Franciscan Order, and their charism is based on the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder, Saint Francis of Assisi.

In summary, the Carmelites, Franciscans, and Capuchin friars are all significant orders of friars within the Catholic Church, each with their unique charism and spiritual disciplines. These orders have been influential in shaping the religious landscape of the Church and continue to play a vital role in the lives of their members and the communities they serve.

It was Sturges's first film as a director; he sold the story to Paramount Pictures for just $10 on condition he direct the film. Sturges went on to win the Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay. In a modern sense, comedy (from the , ""kmidía"") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old"". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. Akim Mikhailovich Tamiroff (; birth name` Hovakim, ; 29 October 1899  17 September 1972) was an ethnic Armenian actor.

","A touchscreen is an important source of input device and output device normally layered on the top of an electronic visual display of an information processing system. A user can give input or control the information processing system through simple or multi-touch gestures by touching the screen with a special stylus and/or one or more fingers. Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work while others use a special stylus/pen only. The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and to control how it is displayed; for example, zooming to increase the text size.

The concept of video games as a form of art is a controversial topic within the entertainment industry. Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even art games, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics. A bowling ball is a piece of sporting equipment used to hit bowling pins in the sport of bowling. Ten-pin bowling balls are typically hard spheres with three holes drilled in them, one each for the ring and middle fingers, and one for the thumb. Regulating bodies such as the USBC maintain requirements for the properties of bowling balls, including size, hardness, and number of holes, as well as maintaining a list of bowling balls approved for competitive play. Other bowling balls, such as those used in five-pin bowling, candlepin bowling, and duckpin bowling are smaller, lighter, and without holes, so that they may be held in the palm of the bowler's hand. Most bowling alleys provide balls for patrons to use within the establishment, often referred to as ""house balls.""

The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.

Five-pin bowling is a bowling variant which is played only in Canada, where many bowling alleys offer it, either alone or in combination with ten-pin bowling. It was devised around 1909 by Thomas F. Ryan in Toronto, Ontario, at his ""Toronto Bowling Club"", in response to customers who complained that the ten-pin game was too strenuous. He cut five tenpins down to about 75% of their size, and used hand-sized hard rubber balls, thus inventing the original version of five-pin bowling.

An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games). North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas.

Bowling refers to a series of sports or leisure activities in which a player rolls or throws a bowling ball towards a target. It is one of the major forms of throwing sports. In pin bowling variations, the target is usually to knock over pins at the end of a lane. When all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, this is a strike. In target variations, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible. The pin version of bowling is often played on a flat wooden or other synthetic surface (which can be oiled in different patterns for different techniques), while in target bowling, the surface may be grass, gravel or a synthetic surface. The most common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, nine-pin, candlepin, duckpin and five-pin bowling, while in target bowling, bowls, skittles, kegel, bocce, carpet bowls, pétanque, and boules, both indoor and outdoor varieties are popular.

A mobile phone is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Most modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and therefore mobile telephones are often also called ""cellular telephones"" or ""cell phones"". In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming, and digital photography.

","Historical fiction is a literary genre in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past. Historical fiction can be an ambiguous term: frequently it is used as a synonym for describing the historical novel; however, the term can be applied to works in other narrative formats, such as those in the performing and visual arts like theatre, opera, cinema, television, comics, and graphic novels. Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see ""literary"" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel ""The Time Machine"", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is ""the person who originated or gave existence to anything"" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities. Alternate history or alternative history (British English), sometimes abbreviated as AH, is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently. These stories usually contain ""what if"" scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record. The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on scientific fact. Alternate history can be seen as a subgenre of literary fiction, science fiction, or historical fiction; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres. Another term occasionally used for the genre is ""allohistory"" (literally ""other history""). A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called ""screen names""), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.

Technology (""science of craft"", from Greek , ""techne"", ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and , ""-logia"") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a ""literature of ideas."" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. PC games, also known as computer games or personal computer games, are video games played on a personal computer rather than a dedicated video game console or arcade machine. Their defining characteristics include a lack of any centralized controlling authority, a greater degree of user control over the video-gaming hardware and software used and a generally greater capacity in input, processing, and output. The supernatural (Medieval Latin: ""superntrlis"": ""supra"" ""above"" + ""naturalis"" ""natural"", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. Innovation can be defined simply as a ""new idea, device, or method"". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term ""innovation"" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that ""breaks into"" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant ""speculative literature"". A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play. A pen name (""nom de plume"", or ""literary double"") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their ""real"" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an ""extraterrestrial"" or ""alien""), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s ""Islands of Space"" in ""Astounding Science Fiction"". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the ""hard"" (natural) and ""soft"" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful."

It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million. Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: ""RS""), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest.

Noricum is the Latin name for a Celtic kingdom, or federation of tribes, that included most of modern Austria and part of Slovenia. In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, ""Raetia"" and ""Vindelicia"" to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and ""Italia"" (""Venetia et Histria"") to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg. The Pontifex Maximus (Latin, literally: ""greatest pontiff"" or ""greatest bridge-builder"") was the high priest of the College of Pontiffs (""Collegium Pontificum"") in ancient Rome. This was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian (reigned 375383) who, however, then decided to omit the words ""pontifex maximus"" from his title. Although the most influential office within Roman priesthood, the ""pontifex maximus"" was ranked the fifth in the ranking of the highest Roman priests (""ordo sacerdotum""), behind the ""rex sacrorum"" and the ""flamines maiores"" (""Flamen Dialis"", ""Flamen Martialis"", ""Flamen Quirinalis""). Istria (Croatian, Slovene: ""Istra""; Istriot: ""Eîstria""; German: ""Istrien""), formerly ""Histria"" (Latin), is the largest peninsula in the Adriatic Sea. The peninsula is located at the head of the Adriatic between the Gulf of Trieste and the Kvarner Gulf. It is shared by three countries: Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy. Pannonia was an ancient province of the Roman Empire bounded north and east by the Danube, coterminous westward with Noricum and upper Italy, and southward with Dalmatia and upper Moesia. Pannonia was located over the territory of the present-day western Hungary, eastern Austria, northern Croatia, north-western Serbia, northern Slovenia, western Slovakia and northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a ""transitional"" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe. Trieste is a city and seaport in northeastern Italy. It is situated towards the end of a narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia, which lies almost immediately south and east of the city.

Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. Numerian (died 20 November 284) was Roman Emperor from 283 to 284 with his older brother Carinus. They were sons of Carus, a general raised to the office of praetorian prefect under Emperor Probus in 282. The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming ""emperor"" in English, it reflects his taking of the title ""Augustus"" or ""Caesar"". Another title often used was ""imperator"", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title ""princeps"" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably ""Princeps Senatus"", ""Consul"" and ""Pontifex Maximus"". Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.

The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. Carus (c. 222  July or August 283) was Roman Emperor from 282 to 283, and was 60 at ascension. During his short reign, Carus fought the Germanic tribes and Sarmatians along the Danube frontier with success. He brought stability in the empire and died in 283 aged 61. The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title ""Augustus"", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic."

His works include : Gossip : And Satan Came Also Social Donkey An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children's books. An illusion is a distortion of the senses, revealing how the brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. Though illusions distort reality, they are generally shared by most people.
Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.
Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles (e.g., Gestalt theory), an individual's capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside of the body within ones physical environment. Memento mori (""remember that you have to die"") is a Latin expression, originating from a practice common in Ancient Rome; as a general came back victorious from a battle, and during his parade (""Triumph"") received compliments and honors from the crowd of citizens, he ran the risk of falling victim to haughtiness and delusions of grandeur; to avoid it, a slave stationed behind him would say ""Respice post te. Hominem te memento"" (""Look after you [to the time after your death] and remember you're [only] a man.""). It was then reused during the medieval period, it is also related to the ""ars moriendi"" (""The Art of Dying"") and related literature. ""Memento mori"" has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and by turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife. An optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is an illusion caused by the visual system and characterized by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source. There are three main types: literal optical illusions that create images that are different from the objects that make them, physiological illusions that are the effects of excessive stimulation of a specific type (brightness, colour, size, position, tilt, movement), and cognitive illusions, the result of unconscious inferences. Pathological visual illusions arise from a pathological exaggeration in physiological visual perception mechanisms causing the aforementioned types of illusions. Vanitas is a category of symbolic works of art, especially those associated with the still life paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries in Flanders and the Netherlands. The Latin noun ""vntas"", (""tis"", f. ""vanus"") means ""emptiness"", from the Latin adjective ""vanus"", meaning empty, and thus refers in this context to the traditional Christian view of earthly life and the worthless nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. In Christian philosophy, the word ""vanitas"" derives its prominence from the Ecclesiastes, and in the Vulgate the verse is rendered as ""Vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas"". In the King James Version, however, it is translated , and therefore the English word ""vanity"" is used in its older (especially pre-14th century) sense of ""futility"". Charles Allan Gilbert (September 3, 1873  April 20, 1929), better known as C. Allan Gilbert, was a prominent American illustrator. He is especially remembered for a widely published drawing (a memento mori or vanitas) titled ""All Is Vanity"". The drawing employs a double image (or visual pun) in which the scene of a woman admiring herself in a mirror, when viewed from a distance, appears to be a human skull. The title is also a pun, as this type of dressing-table is also known as a vanity. The phrase ""All is vanity"" comes from Ecclesiastes 1:2 (""Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity."") It refers to the vanity and pride of man. In art, vanity has long been represented as a woman preoccupied with her beauty.

Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny. The uterus, also known as the womb, is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ in humans and most other mammals. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. The nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils and is responsible for respiration. Altricial species are those whose young are incapable of moving around on their own soon after birth or hatching. Mammals are vertebrates with specific characteristics such as a neocortex, hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands. The skeleton provides support and protection to the body, while muscles enable movement and maintain posture. Joints connect bones and allow for movement. Birth, or parturition, is the process of bringing forth offspring, which in mammals is initiated by hormones. Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside the female's uterus. Cartilage is a resilient tissue that forms a part of the skeletal system. Hormones are signaling molecules that regulate physiology and behavior. White blood cells are involved in protecting the body against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. Bones are rigid organs that constitute part of the vertebrate skeleton, providing support, protection, and enabling movement. The ear is the organ of hearing and balance in mammals. Marsupials are mammals with distinctive characteristics, including carrying their young in a pouch. Precocial species are those whose young are relatively mature and mobile from birth or hatching. Atelosteogenesis, type II, is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development.

","The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas. The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba.

The PES comprises national-level political parties primarily from member states of the European Union (EU) and other nations of the European continent. The PES member parties are themselves mostly members of the Progressive Alliance or Socialist International. The political group in the European Parliament of the PES is the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). The PES also operates in the Committee of the Regions (in the PES Group in the Committee of the Regions) and the European Council. The PES is currently led by Sergei Stanishev, former Prime Minister of Bulgaria. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of ""Soviet Army"", until its dissolution in December 1991. The Socialist International (SI) is a worldwide association of political parties, most of which seek to establish democratic socialism. It consists mostly of democratic socialist, social-democratic and labour political parties and other organisations.

The People's Republic of Bulgaria (PRB; ""Narodna republika Blgariya (NRB)"") was the official name of the Bulgarian socialist republic. The Peoples Republic of Bulgaria existed from 1946 to 1990, when the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) ruled together with its coalition partner, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union. Bulgaria was part of Comecon, a member of the Warsaw Pact and closely allied with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. A communist state is a state that is usually administered and governed by a single party representing the proletariat, guided by Marxist-Leninist philosophy, with the aim of achieving communism. There have been several instances of Communist states with functioning political participation processes involving several other non-Party organisations, such as trade unions, factory committees, and direct democratic participation. The term ""Communist state"" is used by Western historians, political scientists and media to refer to these countries. However, contrary to Western usage, these states do not describe themselves as ""communist"" nor do they claim to have achieved communism; they refer to themselves as ""Socialist states"" or ""Workers' states"" that are in the process of constructing socialism. The Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) (  , Balgarska Komunisticheska Partiya; , BKP) was the Communist and Marxist-Leninist ruling party of the People's Republic of Bulgaria from 1946 until 1989 when the country ceased to be a communist state.

","Name calling is abusive or insulting language referring to a person or group , a verbal abuse . This phenomenon is studied by a variety of academic disciplines from anthropology , to child psychology , to politics . It is also studied by rhetoricians , and a variety of other disciplines that study propaganda techniques and their causes and effects . The technique is most frequently employed within political discourse and school systems , in an attempt to negatively impact their opponent . Bullying is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse, intimidate, or aggressively dominate others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of social or physical power, which distinguishes bullying from conflict. Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal harassment or threat, physical assault or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets. Rationalizations for such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size or ability. If bullying is done by a group, it is called mobbing. Rhetoric is the art of discourse, wherein a writer or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate particular audiences in specific situations. As a subject of formal study and a productive civic practice, rhetoric has played a central role in the European tradition. Its best known definition comes from Aristotle, who considers it a counterpart of both logic and politics, and calls it ""the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion."" Rhetoric typically provides heuristics for understanding, discovering, and developing arguments for particular situations, such as Aristotle's three persuasive audience appeals, logos, pathos, and ethos. The five canons of rhetoric, which trace the traditional tasks in designing a persuasive speech, were first codified in classical Rome: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. Along with grammar and logic (or dialecticsee Martianus Capella), rhetoric is one of the three ancient arts of discourse. Bias is an inclination or outlook to present or hold a partial perspective, often accompanied by a refusal to consider the possible merits of alternative points of view. Biases can be learned implicitly within cultural contexts. People may develop biases toward or against an individual, an ethnic group, a nation, a religion, a social class, a political party, theoretical paradigms and ideologies within academic domains, or a species. Biased means one-sided, lacking a neutral viewpoint, or not having an open mind. Bias can come in many forms and is related to prejudice and intuition. Propaganda is ""information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view"". Propaganda is often associated with the psychological mechanisms of influencing and altering the attitude of a population toward a specific cause, position or political agenda in an effort to form a consensus to a standard set of belief patterns. Verbal abuse (also known as reviling or ""verbal bullying"") is described as a negative defining statement told to the victim or about the victim, or by withholding any response, thereby defining the target as non-existent. If the abuser does not immediately apologize and retract the defining statement, the relationship may be a verbally abusive one. Ethos (or ) is a Greek word meaning ""character"" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals. Early Greek stories of Orpheus exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in rhetoric is closely based on the Greek terminology used by Aristotle in his concept of the three artistic proofs. Abuse is the improper usage or treatment of an entity, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit. Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices; crimes, or other types of aggression."

South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to ""Wide Bantu"", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and ""Ethnologue"" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the ""Old World"" from the ""New World"".

The album, produced entirely by RZA (then known as Prince Rakeem), showcases the group's unique sound, heavily influenced by martial arts films and soul music samples. The album's title is derived from the martial arts film ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin.""

The album features eight original members of the Wu-Tang Clan, including RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, and U-God. Cappadonna later joined the group as an official member. The album's standout track, ""Protect Ya Neck,"" features Method Man, who would later collaborate with Redman on the hit single ""Method of Modern Love.""

The album's success led to the formation of the Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop collective that would go on to achieve mainstream success with their 1993 debut album ""Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)."" The group's members pursued solo careers, with Ghostface Killah releasing his debut solo album ""Ironman"" in 1996 and Method Man collaborating with Mary J. Blige on the Grammy Award-winning single ""I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By.""

The album's production was heavily influenced by RZA's use of eerie beats and soul music samples, creating a unique sound that would become a hallmark of the Wu-Tang Clan's music. The album's success helped establish the Wu-Tang Clan as one of the most influential hip hop groups of the 1990s, and their music continues to inspire artists today. ","Helen Cresswell ( 11 July 1934 -- 26 September 2005 ) was an English television scriptwriter and author of more than 100 children 's books , best known for comedy and supernatural fiction . Her most popular book series , Lizzie Dripping and The Bagthorpe Saga , were also the bases for television series . Cresswell 's TV work included adaptation of her own books for television movies and series : Lizzie Dripping ( two series , 1973 -- 75 ) , The Secret World of Polly Flint ( 1987 ) , and Moondial ( 1988 ) . Some others were The Haunted School , Five Children and It ( 1991 ) , The Phoenix and the Carpet , The Famous Five ( 1995 -- 96 ) , and The Demon Headmaster ( 1996 -- 98 ) . Faber and Faber Limited, often abbreviated to Faber, is an independent publishing house in the United Kingdom. Faber has published some of the most well-known literature in the English language, including William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"". Poet T. S. Eliot was once a Faber editor.  The Bagthorpe Saga is a series of 10 fiction books written by author Helen Cresswell between 1977 and 2001. The series became the basis of a TV comedy series - also called The Bagthorpe Saga - in 1981, and also won two International Reading Association awards. The books were published in the UK and the United States by Faber and Faber. Blue Peter is a British children's television programme, shown currently live on the CBBC television channel. A significant part of British culture, it first aired in 1958 and is the longest-running children's TV show in the world. Although the show has a nautical title and theme, it is a magazine/entertainment show containing viewer and presenter challenges, as well as the famous arts and crafts ""makes"". Lizzie Dripping (released in its second year under the title, Lizzy Dripping Again) was a British television children's programme produced by the BBC in 1973 and 1975. It was written by Helen Cresswell and set in the country village of Little Hemlock, where a young girl, Penelope, with a vivid imagination (played by future ""Blue Peter"" presenter Tina Heath) encounters a local witch (Sonia Dresdel) whom only she can see and hear. This singular ability is further complicated by the fact that Penelope has established a reputation for being an imaginative liar, making it even more difficult for her to convince others that her witch is real. Tina Heath is a British actress and former television presenter. Her first TV appearance came in 1969, when she appeared in ""Broaden Your Mind"" on BBC Two alongside Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor. A one-off appearance in ""Z-Cars"" followed in 1970. In 1973, she played the title role in the popular children's television serial ""Lizzie Dripping"" after first playing the character in an episode of ""Jackanory Playhouse"" in 1972; her character was supposed to be 12 years old, but in fact Heath was already 20 at the time. She also played, in that same year's BBC miniseries production of ""Jane Eyre"" (1973), the character of Helen Burns, the fourteen-year-old boarding-school girl who is cruelly birched by Miss Scatcherd and who befriends the ten-year-old Jane when Jane is a newcomer to Lowood Institute. Other TV appearances included a role in the BBC's ""Play Of The Month: The Linden Tree"" by J.B. Priestley in 1974; ""Churchill's People"" in 1975; and Muriel Spark's ""The Girls Of Slender Means""."

Tin, a chemical element with the symbol Sn and atomic number 50, is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4.

The state of Chhattisgarh, with a population of 28 million, is the seventh-largest country by area and the second-most populous country in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. Chhattisgarh shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east.

Chhattisgarh's capital city is Raipur, which is also the administrative headquarters of the district. The state is rich in mineral resources, and there are many wildlife sanctuaries and sightseeing places worth visiting. The district has a population of 30 lakhs.

Chhattisgarh is one of the fastest-developing states in India, with provisions made for its expansion and to upgrade infrastructure in the future. The state's jurisdiction is governed by the laws of India, which are enforced through social and governmental institutions.

In summary, Chhattisgarh is a state in central India, rich in mineral resources, including tin. Its capital city is Raipur, and the state is known for its fast-developing infrastructure and various wildlife sanctuaries and sightseeing places. ","A restaurant (or ), or an eatery, is a business which prepares and serves food and drinks to customers in exchange for money. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services, and some only offer take-out and delivery. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.  A hot dog (also spelled hotdog) is a cooked sausage, traditionally grilled or steamed and served in a sliced bun as a sandwich. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in blankets. Typical hot dog garnishes include mustard, ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, relish, coleslaw, cheese, chili, olives, and sauerkraut. A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are ""almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region"". A related United Nations paper adds that ""every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct"". Nathan Handwerker ( June 14 , 1892 -- March 24 , 1974 ) was a Jewish - American entrepreneur who immigrated from Eastern Europe , and who is known for founding the Nathan 's Famous brand of restaurants specializing in hot dogs . Pigs in blankets (or ""pigs in a blanket"") refers to a variety of different sausage-based foods in the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Russia, Canada, and Japan. Many are large, but other recipes call for a dish that is small in size and can be eaten in one or two bites. For this reason, they are usually served as an appetizer or hors d'oeuvre or are accompanied by other dishes in the 'main course' section of a meal. In the West, especially in the United States and Canada, the bite-sized variety of pig in a blanket is a common hors d'oeuvre served at cocktail parties and is often accompanied by a mustard or aioli dipping sauce. Fast food is a type of mass-produced food that is prepared and served very quickly. It began with the first fish and chip shops in Britain in the 1860s. Drive-through restaurants were first popularized in the 1950s in the United States. The food is typically less nutritionally valuable compared to other foods and dishes. While any meal with low preparation time can be considered fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away. Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through. The term ""fast food"" was recognized in a dictionary by MerriamWebster in 1951. The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.

","In typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes of writing. As such, glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word, or otherwise contribute to a specific meaning of what is written, with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage. A (named , plural ""As"", ""A's"", ""a""s, ""a's"" or ""aes"") is the first letter and the first vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey . The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. Type design is the art and process of designing typeface . Garamond is a group of many old-style serif typefaces, originally those designed by Parisian craftsman Claude Garamond and other 16th century French engravers, and now many modern revivals. Though his name was written as 'Garamont' in his lifetime, the typefaces are generally spelled 'Garamond'. Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information. In typography, a typeface (also known as font family) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts). For example, ""ITC Garamond Bold Condensed Italic"" means the bold, condensed-width, italic version of ITC Garamond. It is a different font from ""ITC Garamond Condensed Italic"" and ""ITC Garamond Bold Condensed,"" but all are fonts within the same typeface, ""ITC Garamond."" ITC Garamond is a different typeface from ""Adobe Garamond"" or ""Monotype Garamond."" (These are all alternative updates or digitisations of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.)
There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly. In metal typesetting, a font is a particular size, weight and style of a typeface. Each font was a matched set of type, one piece (called a ""sort"") for each glyph, and a typeface consisting of a range of fonts that shared an overall design."

119,What is the medical specialty that deals with substance abuse?,psychiatry,"['emergency medicine', 'infectious disease', 'pathology', 'psychiatry', 'surgery']"," Anne Perry is an English author best known for her historical detective fiction series featuring Thomas Pitt and William Monk. Born Juliet Marion Hulme on October 28, 1938, Perry was convicted of murder at the age of fifteen. After serving her five-year sentence, she changed her name and began writing.

Thomas Pitt, the protagonist of Perry's series, is a police inspector from a working-class background in Victorian London. His father was a gamekeeper on a landed estate, and Pitt was educated alongside the son of the house. Pitt's father was wrongly accused of poaching game and transported to Australia, prompting Pitt to enter the police force.

At the beginning of the series, Pitt is a police inspector, but he is later promoted to superintendent. However, he is removed from his job after investigating the ""wrong people,"" i.e., those with sufficient influence and power. He joins the Special Branch, where he becomes an inspector and later a commander as Head of Special Branch.

Pitt's wife, Charlotte Ellison, is from an upper-class family. Her sister, Emily, is married to a viscount and a rising politician. Charlotte frequently uses Emily's connections to assist Pitt in his investigations. She relies on her maid, Gracie, to take care of her children, Jemima and Daniel, when Pitt is investigating a mystery.

Vespasia Cumming-Gould, the elderly aunt of Emily's first husband, becomes a friend to both Emily and Charlotte, easing their way into society. The first novel in the series, The Cater Street Hangman, was adapted for TV in 1998.

","Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat (including serious types), cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present. Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB.
Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids may be used to help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In ST elevation MIs treatments which attempt to restore blood flow to the heart are typically recommended and include angioplasty, where the arteries are pushed open, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use of angioplasty in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty. After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.
Worldwide, about 8.6 million myocardial infarctions occurred in 2013. More than 3 million people had an ST elevation MI and more than 4 million had an NSTEMI. STEMIs occur about twice as often in men as women. About one million people have an MI each year in the United States. In the developed world the risk of death in those who have had an STEMI is about 10%. Rates of MI for a given age have decreased globally between 1990 and 2010. A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.
The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.
Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. Treatment to try recover lost function is called stroke rehabilitation and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.
In 2013 approximately 6.9 million people had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million people had a hemorrhagic stroke. In 2010 there were about 33 million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2013, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.4 million deaths (12% of the total). About 3.3 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.2 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old. Substituted amphetamines are a class of compounds based upon the amphetamine structure; it includes all derivative compounds which are formed by replacing, or substituting, one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents. The compounds in this class span a variety of pharmacological subclasses, including stimulants, empathogens, and hallucinogens, among others. Examples of substituted amphetamines are amphetamine (itself), methamphetamine, ephedrine, cathinone, phentermine, mephentermine, bupropion, methoxyphenamine, selegiline, amfepramone, pyrovalerone, MDMA (ecstasy), and DOM (STP). A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone. It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and hyperreflexia. The term ""muscle relaxant"" is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics. Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system (CNS) activity. They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis. Spasmolytics, also known as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants, the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only. Mephentermine is a cardiac stimulant. It was formerly used in Wyamine nasal decongestant inhalers and before that as a stimulant in psychiatry. A pandemic (from Greek  ""pan"" ""all"" and  ""demos"" ""people"") is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region; for instance multiple continents, or even worldwide. A widespread endemic disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, flu pandemics generally exclude recurrences of seasonal flu. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as smallpox and tuberculosis. One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death, killing over 75 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the HIV pandemic as well as the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemics. Substance abuse , also known as drug abuse , is a patterned use of a drug in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others , and is a form of substance - related disorder . Widely differing definitions of drug abuse are used in public health , medical and criminal justice contexts . The exact cause of substance abuse is not clear , with theories including : a genetic disposition ; learned from others - or a habit which if addiction develops , manifests as a chronic debilitating disease . Drugs most often associated with this term include : alcohol , substituted amphetamines , barbiturates , benzodiazepines ( particularly alprazolam , lorazepam , diazepam and clonazepam ) , cocaine , methaqualone , cannabis and opioids . In some cases criminal or anti-social behavior occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug , and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well . In addition to possible physical , social , and psychological harm , use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties , although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction . Substance abuse is widespread with an estimated 120 million users of hard drugs such as cocaine , heroin , and other synthetic drugs . In 2013 drug use disorders resulted in 127,000 deaths up from 53,000 in 1990 . The highest number of deaths are from opioid use disorders at 51,000 . Cocaine use disorder resulted in 4,300 deaths and amphetamine use disorder resulted in 3,800 deaths . Alcohol use disorders resulted in an additional 139,000 deaths . Methaqualone, sold under the brand name Quaalude (\kw-lüd\) in the US and Mandrax in the UK and South Africa, is a sedative and hypnotic medication. It is a member of the quinazolinone class.
The sedativehypnotic activity of methaqualone was first noted by researchers in the 1950s. In 1962, methaqualone was patented in the US by Wallace and Tiernan. Its use peaked in the early 1970s as a hypnotic, for the treatment of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant. Public health refers to ""the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human health through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals."" It is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). The dimensions of health can encompass ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,"" as defined by the United Nations' World Health Organization. Public health incorporates the interdisciplinary approaches of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, insurance medicine, mental health and occupational safety and health are other important subfields. Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.
Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.
Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the bloodbrain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the ""coca"" plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year. With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.
After cannabis, cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life. In 2013 cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. The leaves of the ""coca"" plant have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime."

Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. Art Nouveau (Anglicised to ) is an international style of art, architecture and applied art, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1890 and 1910. A reaction to the academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers. Academic art, or Academicism, is a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies of art. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Thomas Couture, and Hans Makart. In this context it is often called ""academism"", ""academicism"", ""L'art pompier"", and ""eclecticism"", and sometimes linked with ""historicism"" and ""syncretism"".

","London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it ""Londinium"". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, ""London"" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. In a modern sense, comedy (from the , ""kmidía"") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old"". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. Used colloquially as a noun or adjective, ""highbrow"" is synonymous with intellectual; as an adjective, it also means elite, and generally carries a connotation of high culture. The word draws its metonymy from the pseudoscience of phrenology, and was originally simply a physical descriptor. 60 Minute Makeover is a British daytime home interior design television programme broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom. In 2013, Peter Andre took over as the main presenter for the show with the show's name changed to reflect this. BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997. Catherine Gee ( born July 1967 ) is a television presenter and property expert who took over as the host of the popular ITV daytime makeover show 60 Minute Makeover in 2011 . Prior to this she was best known for presenting the BBC relocation programme , Escape to the Country and being the location presenter on the long - running BBC Two panel game Through the Keyhole . She also ran Country Living 's The Farmer Wants a Wife matchmaking campaign , presenting the related television programme . She has had a range of careers including working as a personal chef in the City , an estate agent before she joined Country Living as an assistant editor in 1995 . It was whilst she was Head of Shows , organising such events as the Country Living Fairs , that in 1999 she became involved in the magazine 's first matchmaking campaign for farmers The Farmer Wants a Wife . She ran the second campaign which was televised by Thames TV and was nominated for a BAFTA in 2002 . It was as a result of this that she was spotted and approached by Talkback Productions to present , firstly , their new BBC2 property relocation show Escape to the Country in 2002 , and then to replace Loyd Grossman in 2004 as Sir David Frost 's location presenter on the long - running Through the Keyhole . She also presents a UKTV Style show called A Place by the Sea , and No Place Like Home ? on the ITV network in the UK . A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts, or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid. The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting, thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without, or with only supplemental, funding from radio and television advertisements. However, in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax. Broadcasting House is the headquarters of the BBC, in Portland Place and Langham Place, London. The first radio broadcast was made on 15 March 1932, and the building was officially opened two months later, on 15 May. The main building is in Art Deco style, with a facing of Portland stone over a steel frame. It is a Grade II* listed building and includes the BBC Radio Theatre, where music and speech programmes are recorded in front of a studio audience, and lobby that was used as a location for filming the 1998 BBC television series ""In the Red"". Escape to the Country is a British daytime television real estate-buying programme which premieres on network BBC One and is repeated on BBC Two, and airs internationally in syndication. A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, ""channel 2"" refers to the broadcast or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB).

They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km. BBC Two is the second television channel operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It covers a wide range of subject matter, but tending towards more ""highbrow"" programmes than the more mainstream and popular BBC One. Like the BBC's other domestic TV and radio channels, it is funded by the television licence, and is therefore commercial-free. It is a comparatively well-funded public service network, regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public service networks worldwide.

","Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete. An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called ""readers""), theatre, music (in which they are called ""listeners""), video games (in which they are called ""players""), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception. The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Max Wertheimer, one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, defined this phenomenon in 1912. The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision together formed the foundation of Hugo Münsterberg's theory of film and are part of the process of motion perception. In filmmaking, visual effects (abbreviated VFX) are the processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated outside the context of a live action shot.  ""Cold Turkey"" is a song written by John Lennon, released as a single in 1969 by the Plastic Ono Band on Apple Records, catalogue Apples 1001 in the United Kingdom, Apple 1813 in the United States. It is the second solo single issued by Lennon, and it peaked at number 30 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and number 14 on the UK Singles Chart. The song's first appearance on an album was ""Live Peace in Toronto 1969"" where the song had been performed live on 13 September 1969 with Lennon reading the lyrics off a clip-board. A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. Smoking cessation (colloquially quitting smoking) is the process of discontinuing tobacco smoking. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive. Nicotine makes the process of quitting often very prolonged and difficult.
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide, and quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk of dying from tobacco-related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer. Seventy percent of smokers would like to quit smoking, and 50 percent report attempting to quit within the past year. Many different strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including quitting without assistance (""cold turkey"" or cut down then quit), medications such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), cytisine or varenicline, and behavioral counseling. The majority of smokers who try to quit do so without assistance, though only 3% to 6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful. Use of medications and behavioral counseling both increase success rates, and a combination of both medication and behavioral interventions has been shown to be even more effective. Tobacco smoking is the practice of burning tobacco and inhaling the smoke (consisting of particle and gaseous phases). (A more broad definition may include simply taking tobacco smoke into the mouth, and then releasing it, as is done by some with tobacco pipes and cigars.) The practice was believed to begin as early as 50003000 BC. Tobacco was introduced to Eurasia in the late 17th century where it followed common trade routes. The practice encountered criticism from its first import into the Western world onwards, but embedded itself in certain strata of a number of societies before becoming widespread upon the introduction of automated cigarette-rolling apparatus. Nicotine is a potent parasympathomimetic alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae) and is a stimulant drug. Nicotine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, except at nAChR9 and nAChR10 where it acts as an antagonist. Nicotine is found in the leaves of ""Nicotiana rustica"" in amounts of 214%, the tobacco plant ""Nicotiana tabacum"", ""Duboisia hopwoodii"" and ""Asclepias syriaca"". Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.
The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.
Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world.
Signs and symptoms.
Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: Computer animation is the process used for generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation ""only"" refers to the moving images. Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well. Les Inconnus (""The Unknowns"") are a French trio of humorists: Didier Bourdon, Bernard Campan and Pascal Légitimus. While their first successes were on stage, they are most famous for their satirical sketch comedy television show ""La Télé des Inconnus"", which premiered in 1990 and remained popular throughout the early 1990s. Following their television success, the group began to make music and movies, most of them written and directed by Bourdon and Campan. After the movie ""Les Trois Frères"" in 1995, the trio encountered contract problems with their manager Paul Lederman, which caused the group to split up, though there have been several films that have featured at least two former members together.  The Bet ( French title : Le Pari ) is a 1997 film directed , about smoking cessation , written , and starred by Didier Bourdon and Bernard Campan of the French comic trio Les Inconnus ( `` The Unknowns '' ) . Bernard Campan (born 4 April 1958) is a French actor, film director and writer. He is a member of Les Inconnus trio of humorists. He won a César Award for Best Debut for ""Les Trois Frères"", and was nominated for best actor for his role in ""Se souvenir des belles choses"". Cytisine, also known as baptitoxine and sophorine, is an alkaloid that occurs naturally in several plant genera, such as ""Laburnum"" and ""Cytisus"" of the family Fabaceae. It has been used medically to help with smoking cessation. Its molecular structure has some similarity to that of nicotine and it has similar pharmacological effects. Like varenicline, cytisine is a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Cytisine has a short half-life of 4.8 hours, and is rapidly eliminated from the body. The use of cytisine for smoking cessation remains relatively unknown outside Eastern Europe. Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called ""sketches"", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television.

A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people). When the input information is supplied has an electrical signal, the display is called an ""electronic display"". A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word ""video"" in ""video game"" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. A handheld game console is a small, portable self-contained video game console with a built-in screen, game controls, and speakers. Handheld game consoles are smaller than home video game consoles and contain the console, screen, speakers, and controls in one unit, allowing people to carry them and play them at any time or place. The concept of video games as a form of art is a controversial topic within the entertainment industry. Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even art games, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.

The company went bankrupt before releasing any of the models . The XGP was scheduled to be released in three models : the XGP , the XGPmini and the XGP Kids . GamePark said that it did not wish to compete with Sony and Nintendo with the device . The XGP Kids was aimed towards children and therefore had a significantly lower price point . It was designed to run simpler games tailored to an audience besides ' hardcore gamers ' . While the GP32 was only available in select markets -- Korea and parts of Europe and Asia -- or had to be imported , the XGP was expected to be marketed worldwide Since Gamepark declared bankruptcy in March 2007 , the XGP will not be released . This left GP2X -- created by splinter company Gamepark Holdings -- as the only successor to the GP32 to make it to market . The GP32 (GamePark 32) is a handheld game console developed by the Korean company Game Park. It was released on November 23, 2001, in South Korea only. An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games). The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology."

South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. Mswati II (c. 18201868), also known as Mswati and Mavuso III, was the king of Swaziland between 1840 and 1868. He was also the eponym of Swaziland. Mswati is considered to be one of the greatest fighting kings of Swaziland. Under his kingship, the territorial boundaries of Swaziland were greatly increased. Mswati was the son of Sobhuza I and Tsandzile Ndwandwe (known as 'LaZidze) who after ruling as Queen Mother became Queen Regent after the death of her son. After the death of Sobhuza, Mswati inherited an area which extended as far as present day Barberton in the north and included the Nomahasha district in the Portuguese territory of Mozambique. Mswatis military power initially suppressed by infighting with his brothers Fokoti, Somcuba and Malambule was increased in the late 1850s and later on. When Mswati's armies attacked organized forces of other Bantu tribes or nations, the goal was initially plunder in the form of cattle and captives, rather than incorporation into one political unit. The arrival of Trekboers in what would become the Transvaal republic marked the first contact with Swazis and European settlers occurred during this period. Mswati greatly extended the boundaries of the Swazi territory beyond that of the present state with military outposts and royal villages outposts such as Mbhuleni, on the upper Komati River at the foot of the Mkongomo Mountains, south of Badplaas, Mekemeke which is east of the Mbayiyane Mountains, situated east of Mantibovu (Lows Creek). The death of Mswati II in July 1868 ended the era of Swazi conquest, territorial expansion and resulted in unification of various people into one nation. John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes (; 5 June 1883  21 April 1946), was a British economist. His ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and is widely considered to be one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and the founder of modern macroeconomics. His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics and its various offshoots. The ""International Monetary Fund"" (IMF) is an international organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., of ""189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world."" Formed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system. It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises. Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money. , the fund had SDR 477 billion (about $668 billion). The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an inter-governmental organization headquartered in Gaborone, Botswana. Its goal is to further socio-economic cooperation and integration as well as political and security cooperation among 15 southern African states. It complements the role of the African Union. The balance of payments, also known as balance of international payments and abbreviated BoP, of a country is the record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and the rest of the world in a particular period (over a quarter of a year or more commonly over a year). These transactions are made by individuals, firms and government bodies. Thus the balance of payments includes all external visible and non-visible transactions of a country. It is an important issue to be studied, especially in international financial management field, for a few reasons. First, the balance of payments provides detailed information concerning the demand and supply of a country's currency. For example, if the United States imports more than it exports, then this means that the supply of dollars is likely to exceed the demand in the foreign exchanging market, ""ceteris paribus"". One can thus infer that the U.S. dollar would be under pressure to depreciate against other currencies. On the other hand, if the United States exports more than it imports, then the dollar would be likely to appreciate. Second, a country's balance-of-payment data may signal its potential as a business partner for the rest of the world. If a country is grappling with a major balance-of-payment difficulty, it may not be able to expand imports from the outside world. Instead, the country may be tempted to impose measures to restrict imports and discourage capital outflows in order to improve the balance-of-payment situation. On the other hand, a country experiencing a significant balance-of payment surplus would be more likely to expand imports, offering marketing opportunities for foreign enterprises, and less likely to impose foreign exchange restrictions. Third, balance-of-payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition. Suppose a country is experiencing trade deficits year after year. This trade data may then signal that the country's domestic industries lack international competitiveness. To interpret balance-of-payments data properly, it is necessary to understand how the balance of payments account is constructed.
These transactions include payments for the country's exports and imports of goods, services, financial capital, and financial transfers. It is prepared in a single currency, typically the domestic currency for the country concerned. Sources of funds for a nation, such as exports or the receipts of loans and investments, are recorded as positive or surplus items. Uses of funds, such as for imports or to invest in foreign countries, are recorded as negative or deficit items. The African Union (AU) is a continental union consisting of all 55 countries on the African continent. It was established on 26 May 2001 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and launched on 9 July 2002 in South Africa, with the aim of replacing the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The most important decisions of the AU are made by the Assembly of the African Union, a semi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states. The AU's secretariat, the African Union Commission, is based in Addis Ababa. Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini ( born 15 May 1942 ) is the Prime Minister of Swaziland .

Following the September 2008 parliamentary election , Dlamini was reappointed as Prime Minister by Mswati III on 16 October 2008 . Jan Sithole , the Secretary - General of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions , was critical of the appointment , saying that Dlamini worked to `` suppress political organisations and advance the strong rule of the monarchy '' during his earlier period as Prime Minister ; he also accused Dlamini of `` strong - hand tactics and lack of respect for the rule of law '' . Opposition leader Mario Masuku , the President of the People 's United Democratic Movement , said that Dlamini `` was not appointed on merit but on his level of allegiance to the king '' . Dlamini was sworn in by Chief Justice Richard Banda on 23 October 2008 . He took the oath of office both in English and in SiSwati . Harry Dexter White (October 9, 1892  August 16, 1948) was an American economist and senior U.S. Treasury department official. Working closely with the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., he helped set American financial policy toward the Allies of World War II while at the same time he passed numerous secrets to the Soviet Union. He was the senior American official at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, that established the postwar economic order. He dominated the conference and imposed his vision of post-war financial institutions over the objections of John Maynard Keynes, the British representative. At Bretton Woods, White was a major architect of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The Chairperson of the African Union Commission is the head of the African Union Commission. On January 30, 2017, it was announced that Chad's Moussa Faki would become the next Chairperson. The Bretton Woods Conference, formally known as the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, was the gathering of 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations at the Mount Washington Hotel, situated in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, to regulate the international monetary and financial order after the conclusion of World War II."

Their careers spanned several decades and left a lasting impact on popular culture. ","Sophocles (""Sophokls"", ; 497/6  winter 406/5 BC) is one of three ancient Greek tragedians whose plays have survived. His first plays were written later than those of Aeschylus, and earlier than or contemporary with those of Euripides. Sophocles wrote 120 plays during the course of his life, but only seven have survived in a complete form: ""Ajax"", ""Antigone"", ""The Women of Trachis"", ""Oedipus the King"", ""Electra"", ""Philoctetes"" and ""Oedipus at Colonus"". For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in 30 competitions, won 18, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won 14 competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles, while Euripides won 5 competitions. The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. Sicyon (""gen"".: ) was an ancient Greek city state situated in the northern Peloponnesus between Corinth and Achaea on the territory of the present-day regional unit of Corinthia. An ancient monarchy at the times of the Trojan War, the city was ruled by a number of tyrants during the Archaic and Classical period and became a democracy in the 3rd century BC. Sicyon was celebrated for its contributions to ancient Greek art, producing many famous painters and sculptors. In Hellenistic times it was also the home of Aratus of Sicyon, the leader of the Achaean League. Aeschylus (or ; ""Aiskhulos"" c. 525/524  c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in theater allowing conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the chorus. Neophron ( bird ) is a link to a genus of birds of prey , containing the Egyptian Vulture . Neophron of Sicyon (  , -  ) was one of the most prolific of the ancient Greek dramatists , to whom are accredited one hundred and twenty pieces , of which only a few fragments of his Medea remain . This , it is said , Euripides used in his tragedy which bears the same title , although modern scholarship is divided on which tragedy came first . Neophron likely lived in the second half of the fifth century B.C. and was a rough contemporary of Euripides . As Suidas tells us , he introduced in his plays the torture of slaves , such scenes , according to the canons of dramatic art , not being produced on the stage , but merely referred to by messengers . Euripides (or ; ) (c. 480  c. 406 BC) was a tragedian of classical Athens. He is one of the few whose plays have survived, with the others being Aeschylus, Sophocles, and potentially Euphorion. Some ancient scholars attributed 95 plays to him but according to the ""Suda"" it was 92 at most. Of these, 18 or 19 have survived more or less complete (there has been debate about his authorship of ""Rhesus"", largely on stylistic grounds) and there are also fragments, some substantial, of most of the other plays. More of his plays have survived intact than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together, partly due to mere chance and partly because his popularity grew as theirs declinedhe became, in the Hellenistic Age, a cornerstone of ancient literary education, along with Homer, Demosthenes and Menander. Homer (, ""Hómros"") is the name ascribed by the Ancient Greeks to the semi-legendary author of the two epic poems, the ""Iliad"" and the ""Odyssey"", the central works of Greek literature. Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. The modern scholarly consensus is that these traditions do not have any historical value. In Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans (Greeks) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably through Homer's ""Iliad"". The ""Iliad"" relates four days in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the ""Odyssey"" describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid. Aratus (271213 BC) was a statesman of the ancient Greek city-state of Sicyon and a leader of the Achaean League. He deposed the Sicyonian tyrant Nicocles in 251 BC. Aratus was an advocate of Greek unity and brought Sicyon into the Achaean League, which he led to its maximum extent. He was elected ""strategos"" many times and led the Achaeans against Macedonia, the Aetolians and the Spartans. After the Spartans defeated and nearly destroyed the cities of the Achaean League, he requested Antigonus Doson of Macedonia to help fight against the Aetolians and Spartans. After Antigonus died in 222 BC, Aratus did not get along with Philip V of Macedon, who wanted to make the Achaean League subject to Macedonia. Polybius and Plutarch record that Philip had Aratus poisoned. Demosthenes (""Dmosthéns"" 384  12 October 322 BC) was a Greek statesman and orator of ancient Athens. His orations constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the politics and culture of ancient Greece during the 4th century BC. Demosthenes learned rhetoric by studying the speeches of previous great orators. He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer (logographer) and a lawyer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits. The Suda or Souda is a large 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Suidas. It is an encyclopedic lexicon, written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. The derivation is probably from the Byzantine Greek word ""souda"", meaning ""fortress"" or ""stronghold,"" with the alternate name, ""Suidas"", stemming from an error made by Eustathius, who mistook the title for the author's name."

","Post-punk (originally ""new musick"") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. Sixteen Stone is the debut album of British rock band Bush, released on 6 December 1994, through Trauma Records.

Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term ""indie"" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, ""indie"" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres. Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as ""rock and roll"" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word ""alternative"" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, ""alternative"" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). `` Everything Zen '' is the debut single released by British alternative rock band Bush in early 1995 from their debut album Sixteen Stone . Trauma Records is a Los Angeles based independent record label created in 1993 by Paul Palmer and Rob Kahane.

Punk rock (or simply ""punk"") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as ""proto-punk"" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels."

Mattia Gavazzi, an Italian road cyclist, competed in the Tour de San Luis in 2013 after a suspension for cocaine use. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that affects the brain's reward pathway, leading to addiction. It is made from the leaves of the coca plant, which are grown in South America. The illegal market for cocaine is estimated to be between 100 and 500 billion USD annually.

Cocaine use is a significant global issue, with between 14 and 21 million people using the drug each year. The highest usage rates are in North America, followed by Europe and South America. Cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths in 2013, up from 2,400 in 1990. The coca plant has been used by Peruvians for centuries, and cocaine was first isolated from its leaves in 1860. Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to criminalize recreational cocaine use. ","A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective.

Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. Rugby league football, usually called rugby league, is a full contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field. One of the two codes of rugby football, it originated in England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players. Its rules gradually changed with the aim of producing a faster, more entertaining game for spectators. Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line. Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word ""football"" is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called 'football' in certain places include: association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes. Handball (also known as team handball or Olympic handball) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outfield players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins. Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone). Australian rules football, officially known as Australian football, but also called Aussie rules, football or footy (and in some regions marketed as AFL after the Australian Football League), is a contact sport played between two teams of eighteen players on an oval-shaped field, often a modified cricket ground.

American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. A football team is the collective name given to a group of players selected together in the various team sports known as football . Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team , to represent a football club , group , state or nation , an All - star team or even selected as a hypothetical team ( such as a Dream Team or Team of the Century ) and never play an actual match . There are several varieties of football , notably Association football , Gridiron football , Australian rules football , Gaelic football , rugby league , and rugby union . The number of players selected for each team within these varieties and their associated codes can vary substantially . In some , use of the word `` team '' is sometimes limited to those who play on the field in a match and does not always include other players who may take part as replacements or emergency players . `` Football squad '' may be used to be inclusive of these support and reserve players . The term football club is the most commonly used for a sports club which is an organised or incorporated body with a president , committee and a set of rules responsible for ensuring the continued playing existence of one or more teams which are selected for regular competition play ( and which may participate in several different divisions or leagues ) . The oldest football clubs date back to the early 19th century . The words team and club are sometimes used interchangeably by supporters , although they typically refer to the team within the club playing in the highest division or competition . Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports."

133,What is the sport associated with the UCI BMX World Championships?,bicycle motocross,"['bicycle motocross', 'cycling', 'road bicycle racing', 'sport']"," The Meech Lake Accord, negotiated in 1987 by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 10 provincial premiers, aimed to persuade Quebec to endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments by providing some decentralization of the Canadian federation. The Accord was ultimately rejected, leading to the formation of the Bloc Québécois, a federal political party devoted to Quebec nationalism and the promotion of Quebec sovereignty. Lucien Bouchard, the founder of the Bloc Québécois, served as the 27th Premier of Quebec from 1996 to 2001 and was a central figure in the 1995 Quebec referendum.

The Accord's rejection highlighted the tensions between Quebec and the rest of Canada, with Quebec nationalism asserting that the Québécois people are an independent nation. The Department of Canadian Heritage, responsible for policies and programs regarding the arts, culture, media, communications networks, official languages, status of women, sports, and multiculturalism, played a role in promoting Canadian identity and unity.

Canada, the second-largest country in the world, is a federal parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. Its capital is Ottawa, and its largest city is Toronto.

In summary, the Meech Lake Accord and the Bloc Québécois represent the ongoing tensions between Quebec and the rest of Canada. The Accord's rejection and the formation of the Bloc Québécois highlight the importance of Quebec nationalism and the need for a balance between decentralization and unity in the Canadian federation.

Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. Gulliver's Travels, whose full title is Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, (1726, amended 1735), is a prose satire by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and the ""travellers' tales"" literary subgenre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. He himself claimed that he wrote ""Gulliver's Travels"" ""to vex the world rather than divert it"". A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images. Political fiction employs narrative to comment on political events, systems and theories. Works of political fiction, such as political novels, often ""directly criticize an existing society or present an alternative, even fantastic, reality."" It overlaps with the social novel, proletarian novel and social science fiction. Highly influential earlier works include ""Gulliver's Travels"" (1726), ""Candide"" (1759), and ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" (1852). Candide, ou l'Optimisme (French: ) is a French satire first published in 1759 by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment. The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: or, Optimism (1947). It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism (or simply ""optimism"") by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow, painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, ""we must cultivate our garden"", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, ""all is for the best"" in the ""best of all possible worlds""."

Pottery is the craft of making ceramic material into pots or potterywares using mud. Major types of potterywares include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a ""potter"" is called a ""pottery"" (plural ""potteries""). The technical definition of ""pottery"" used by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is ""all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products."" Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word ""mishigamaa"", meaning ""large water"" or ""large lake"". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red.
Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger.

The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Stoneware is a rather broad term for pottery or other ceramics fired at a relatively high temperature. A modern technical definition is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay. Whether vitrified or not, it is nonporous (does not soak up liquids); it may or may not be glazed. Historically, across the world, it has usually been developed after earthenware and before porcelain, and has often been used for high-quality as well as utilitarian wares.
Stoneware is not recognised as a category in traditional East Asian terminology, and much Asian stoneware, such as Chinese Ding ware for example, is counted as porcelain by local definitions. Terms such as ""porcellaneous"" or ""near-porcelain"" may be used in such cases. One widely recognised definition of stoneware is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities, a European industry standard. It states: Shedd Aquarium (formally the John G.

Bruce Joel Rubin (born March 10, 1943, Detroit, Michigan) is an American screenwriter best known for the supernatural romance ""Ghost"", for which he won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He also written the screenplays for the 1990 psychological horror film ""Jacob's Ladder,"" and the science-fiction films ""Deep Impact"" and ""The Last Mimzy"". The term expanded universe (sometimes called an extended universe) is generally used to denote the 'extension' of a media franchise (i.e. a television show, series of featured films, etc.) with other media (generally comics and original novels). This typically involves new adventures for existing characters already developed within the franchise; however in some case entirely new characters and complex mythology are developed. This is not the same as an adaptation, which is a retelling of the same story in a different universe in canon, usually on a different medium. Nearly every media franchise with a committed fan base has some form of expanded universe. A very popular example of this is fan fictions. Fan fictions are stories created by a fan base that portrays existing characters in new and different ways. Romantic comedy films (also known as the portmanteaus romedy or romcom) are films with light-hearted, humorous plotlines, centered on romantic ideals such as that true love is able to surmount most obstacles. One dictionary definition is ""a funny movie, play, or television program about a love story that ends happily"". Another definition states that its ""primary distinguishing feature is a love plot in which two sympathetic and well-matched lovers are united or reconciled"".

It is based on the novel ""Friend"" by Diana Henstell, which was adapted for the screen by Bruce Joel Rubin. A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ""Famous Funnies"", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term ""comic book"" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. Howard Deutch (born September 14, 1950) is an American film and television director. He is perhaps best known for his collaboration with filmmaker John Hughes, having directed two of Hughes' well received screenplays, ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"". Since 2010, he has primarily directed television productions, including multiple episodes of ""Getting On"" and ""True Blood"". Pretty in Pink is a 1986 American romantic comedy film about love and social cliques in American high schools in the 1980s. It is commonly identified as a ""Brat Pack"" film. The film was directed by Howard Deutch, produced by Lauren Shuler Donner, and written by John Hughes, who also served as co-executive producer. It has become a cult favorite. The film was named after the song by The Psychedelic Furs. The Psychedelic Furs are an English rock band founded in London in 1977. Led by singer Richard Butler and his brother Tim Butler on bass guitar, the Psychedelic Furs are one of the many acts spawned from the British post-punk scene. Their music went through several phases, from an initially austere art rock sound, later touching on new wave and hard rock. Giselle Loren, sometimes credited as Giselle Achecar, is an actress most famous for her voice-over work in animation and video games.

","The Blitz, from the German word ""Blitzkrieg"" meaning 'lightning war', was the name used by the British press to describe the heavy air raids carried out over Britain in 1940 and 1941, during the Second World War. Frank Humphrey Sinkler Jennings (19 August 1907  24 September 1950) was an English documentary filmmaker and one of the founders of the Mass Observation organisation. Jennings was described by film critic and director Lindsay Anderson in 1954 as: ""the only real poet that British cinema has yet produced."" Fires Were Started is a 1943 British film written and directed by Humphrey Jennings , filmed in documentary style , showing the lives of firefighters through the Blitz during the Second World War . The film uses actual firemen ( including Cyril Demarne ) rather than professional actors . Blitzkrieg (German, ""lightning war"") is a method of warfare whereby an attacking force, spearheaded by a dense concentration of armoured and motorised or mechanised infantry formations with close air support, breaks through the opponent's line of defence by short, fast, powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders, using speed and surprise to encircle them. Through the employment of combined arms in manoeuvre warfare, blitzkrieg attempts to unbalance the enemy by making it difficult for it to respond to the continuously changing front and defeating it in a decisive (""battle of annihilation""). Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French ""Australasie"") in ""Histoire des navigations aux terres australes"" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for ""south of Asia"" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. Cyril Thomas Demarne OBE (7 February 1905  28 January 2007) was a British firefighter. He served in London during the Second World War, throughout the Blitz. He was later involved in establishing aviation firefighting units in Australasia and in Beirut. In retirement, he wrote several books based on his wartime experiences."
145,What is the parent taxon of Cryptococcus?,tremellaceae,"['animal', 'cryptococcus', 'fungi', 'helix', 'homo', 'human', 'metazoa', 'plant', 'tremellaceae']"," William Vansittart Bowater (15 March 1838 – 28 April 1907) was a British entrepreneur who founded Bowater, a company that grew to become one of the world's largest producers of newspaper print. Today, Bowater has been divided into various market-leading paper-based products businesses, including Rexam, a British-based American-owned multinational consumer packaging company. Rexam, headquartered in London, is a leading manufacturer of beverage cans with 55 plants in over 20 countries across Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.

In June 2016, Rexam was acquired by the American company Ball Corporation, which is best known for its early production of glass jars, lids, and related products used for home canning. Founded in Buffalo, New York, in 1880 as the Wooden Jacket Can Company, the Ball Corporation has expanded and diversified into other business ventures, including aerospace technology, and became the world's largest manufacturer of recyclable metal beverage and food containers.

Bowater's post-World War II expansion and a 30-year period of consolidation led to the formation of a number of globally leading worldwide paper products companies. These companies continue to build on the legacy of William Vansittart Bowater and his pioneering work in the pulp and paper industry. ","In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just ""binomial""), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens"". The ""formal"" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work ""Species Plantarum"" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book ""Pinax theatri botanici"" (English, ""Illustrated exposition of plants"") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. A hypha (plural hyphae, from Greek , huph, web) is a long, branching filamentous structure of a fungus, oomycete, or actinobacterium. In most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium. Yeasts are unicellular fungi that do not grow as hyphae. In cell biology, mitosis is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cyclethe division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other. Cryptococcus ( Greek for `` hidden sphere '' ) is a genus of fungus . These fungi grow in culture as yeasts . The sexual forms or teleomorphs of Cryptococcus species are filamentous fungi in the genus Filobasidiella . The name Cryptococcus is used when referring to the yeast states of the fungi . A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms such as mushrooms and bracket fungi. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals. Filobasidiella is a genus of fungi in the family Tremellaceae. Species are parasitic on other fungi and do not produce distinct basidiocarps (fruit bodies). The genus is the teleomorphic (sexual) state of the yeast genus ""Cryptococcus"", some species of which are human pathogens. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. The Tremellaceae are a family of fungi in the order Tremellales. The family is cosmopolitan and contains both teleomorphic and anamorphic genera, most of the latter being yeasts. All teleomorphic species of fungi in the Tremellaceae are parasites of other fungi, though the yeast states are widespread and not restricted to hosts. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous. Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom. The yeast lineage originated hundreds of millions of years ago, and 1,500 species are currently identified. They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described fungal species. Yeasts are unicellular organisms which evolved from multicellular ancestors, with some species having the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae. Yeast sizes vary greatly, depending on species and environment, typically measuring 34 µm in diameter, although some yeasts can grow to 40 µm in size. Most yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis, and many do so by the asymmetric division process known as budding. A mold (US) or mould is a fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called ""hyphae"". In contrast, fungi that can adopt a single-celled growth habit are called yeasts."

","Mabel at the Wheel is a 1914 American motion picture starring Charles Chaplin and Mabel Normand , and directed by Mabel Normand and Mack Sennett . Leading man or leading gentleman is an informal term for the actor who is the protagonist or plays a love interest to the leading actress in a film or play. A leading man is sometimes an all-rounder; capable of singing, dancing, and acting at a professional level. A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. Mack Sennett (born Michael Sinnott; January 17, 1880  November 5, 1960) was a Canadian-born American director and actor and was known as an innovator of slapstick comedy in film. During his lifetime he was known at times as the ""King of Comedy"". His short ""Wrestling Swordfish"" was awarded the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1932 and he earned an Academy Honorary Award in 1937. An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs ""in the flesh"" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally ""one who answers"". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is ""playing themselves"", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. Mabel Normand (November 9, 1892  February 23, 1930) was an American silent film actress, screenwriter, director, and producer. She was a popular star and collaborator of Mack Sennett in his Keystone Studios films and, at the height of her career in the late 1910s and early 1920s, had her own movie studio and production company. Onscreen, she appeared in 12 successful films with Charles Chaplin and 17 with Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, sometimes writing and directing (or co-writing/directing) movies featuring Chaplin as her leading man.
Throughout the 1920s, her name was linked with widely publicized scandals, including the 1922 murder of William Desmond Taylor and the 1924 shooting of Courtland S. Dines, who was shot by Normand's chauffeur using her pistol. She was not a suspect in either crime. Her film career declined, possibly due to both scandals and a recurrence of tuberculosis in 1923, which led to a decline in her health, retirement from films, and her death in 1930 at age 37. Wrestling Swordfish is a 1931 American short adventure film produced by Mack Sennett. It won an Academy Award in 1932 for Best Short Subject (Novelty). Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound. This name for the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film was introduced in 1974. For the three preceding years it was known as ""Short Subjects, Live Action Films"". The term ""Short Subjects, Live Action Subjects"" was used from 1957 until 1970. From 1936 until 1956 there were two separate awards, ""Best Short Subject, One-reel"" and ""Best Short Subject, Two-reel"". These categories referred to the running time of the short: a reel of film, in this context, being 1000 feet or less, or about 11 minutes. A third category ""Best Short Subject, color"" was used only for 1936 and 1937. From the initiation of short subject awards for 1932 until 1935 the terms were ""Best Short Subject, comedy"" and ""Best Short Subject, novelty"". Below is a list of Oscar-winning short films. The winning film is listed first, with the other nominated films for that year/category below. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis"" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term ""consumption"" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.
Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.
Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times."

Because ""roots music"" (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music. In the 1980s, roots rock enjoyed a revival in response to trends in punk rock, new wave and heavy metal music.

Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as ""one of America's original art forms"".

Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they played in a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War. The band performed at 1969's famed Woodstock Festival. The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and known in Vietnam as Resistance War Against America or simply the American War, was a war that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States, South Korea, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies and the war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war.

Leonard Alfred Schneider (October 13, 1925  August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name Lenny Bruce, was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, and screenwriter.
He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an obscenity trial was followed by a posthumous pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor George Pataki in 2003. He paved the way for future outspoken counterculture-era comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for freedom of speech in the United States. In usage in the United States, a bayou (or , from Cajun French) is a body of water typically found in a flat, low-lying area, and can be either an extremely slow-moving stream or river (often with a poorly defined shoreline), or a marshy lake or wetland. The name ""bayou"" can also refer to a creek whose current reverses daily due to tides and which contains brackish water highly conducive to fish life and plankton. Bayous are commonly found in the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, notably the Mississippi River Delta, with the states of Louisiana and Texas being famous for them. A bayou is frequently an anabranch or minor braid of a braided channel that is moving much more slowly than the mainstem, often becoming boggy and stagnant. Though fauna varies by region, many bayous are home to crawfish, certain species of shrimp, other shellfish, catfish, frogs, toads, American alligators, American crocodiles, herons, turtles, spoonbills, snakes, leeches, and a myriad of other species.
Etymology.
The word was first used by the English in Louisiana and is thought to originate from the Choctaw word ""bayuk"", which means ""small stream"". The first settlements of Bayou Teche, and other bayous, were by the Creoles, and that is why bayous are associated with Creole culture."

It has an area of , or 3.57% of the land mass of Mexico and comprises the northern half of the Baja California Peninsula, north of the 28th parallel, plus oceanic Guadalupe Island. The mainland portion of the state is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Sonora, the U.S. State of Arizona, and the Gulf of California (also known as the ""Sea of Cortez""), and on the south by Baja California Sur. Its northern limit is the U.S. state of California. Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America.

North Shore is a 1987 film about Rick Kane ( Matt Adler ) , a young surfer from a wave tank in Arizona , who heads to surf the season on the North Shore of Oahu and see if he has the skills to cut it as a pro surfer . As he progresses on his journey , he learns the qualities he possesses are not going to pull him through alone . A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. A wave tank is a laboratory setup for observing the behavior of surface waves. The typical wave tank is a box filled with liquid, usually water, leaving open or air-filled space on top. At one end of the tank an actuator generates waves; the other end usually has a wave-absorbing surface. A similar device is the ripple tank, which is flat and shallow and used for observing patterns of surface waves from above. Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West, the Far West, or simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States. Because European settlement in the U.S. expanded westward after its founding, the meaning of the West has evolved over time. Prior to about 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier. A laboratory (CommE or , AmE ; informally, lab) is a facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. In physics and engineering, a ripple tank is a shallow glass tank of water used in schools and colleges to demonstrate the basic properties of waves. It is a specialized form of a wave tank. The ripple tank is usually illuminated from above, so that the light shines through the water. Some small ripple tanks fit onto the top of an overhead projector, i.e. they are illuminated from below. The ripples on the water show up as shadows on the screen underneath the tank. All the basic properties of waves, including reflection, refraction, interference and diffraction, can be demonstrated. In physics, a surface wave is a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media, usually as a gravity wave between two fluids with different densities. A surface wave can also be an elastic (or a seismic) wave, such as with a ""Rayleigh"" or ""Love"" wave. It can also be an electromagnetic wave a refractive index gradient, or along an interface between two media having different dielectric constants. In radio transmission, a ground wave is a surface wave that propagates close to the surface of the Earth. White Water Summer is a 1987 American drama film directed by Jeff Bleckner. An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs ""in the flesh"" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally ""one who answers"". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is ""playing themselves"", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. Nevada (Spanish for ""snowy""; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the ""Silver State"" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy.

The Carmelites are one of the significant orders of friars, alongside the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, and Carmelites. The term ""charism"" refers to the unique contribution of each religious order, which in the case of the Carmelites, is defined by the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder, Augustine of Hippo.

The Franciscan Order, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi, is another prominent group of mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church. The Franciscan Order includes the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. These orders follow the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder and his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary.

Felix of Cantalice, born in 1515 in Italy, was the first Capuchin friar to be canonized as a saint by Pope Clement XI in 1712. The Capuchin friars are a branch of the Franciscan Order, and their charism is based on the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder, Saint Francis of Assisi.

In summary, the Carmelites, Franciscans, and Capuchin friars are all significant orders of friars within the Catholic Church, each with their unique charism and spiritual disciplines. These orders have been influential in shaping the religious landscape of the Church and continue to play a vital role in the lives of their members and the communities they serve.

A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), ""community"" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as """"Urusalima"""" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning ""City of Shalem"" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Negev (Tiberian vocalization: ') or Naqab""' (""an-Naqab"") is a desert and semidesert region of southern Israel. The region's largest city and administrative capital is Beersheba (pop. ), in the north. At its southern end is the Gulf of Aqaba and the resort city of Eilat. It contains several development towns, including Dimona, Arad and Mitzpe Ramon, as well as a number of small Bedouin cities, including Rahat and Tel as-Sabi and Lakyah. There are also several kibbutzim, including Revivim and Sde Boker; the latter became the home of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, after his retirement from politics. Netivot (""""paths"""") is a city in the Southern District of Israel located between Beersheba and Gaza. In it had a population of . The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza""', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards. Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (""""), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus. The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. Tel Aviv-Yafo is a major city in Israel, located on the country's Mediterranean coastline. It is known to be the financial center and the technology hub of Israel, with a population of , making it Israel's second largest city. Tel Aviv is the largest city in the Gush Dan region of Israel. Tel Aviv is also a focal point in the high-tech concentration known as the ""Silicon Wadi"". Beer-Sheva  is the largest city in the Negev desert of southern Israel.

A resident or a member of a moshav can be called a ""moshavnik"" (). The West Bank ("""" ""HaGadah HaMa'aravit"") is a landlocked territory near the Mediterranean coast of Western Asia, forming the bulk of the Palestinian territories. The West Bank shares boundaries (demarcated by the Jordanian-Israeli armistice of 1949) to the west, north, and south with Israel, and to the east, across the Jordan River, with Jordan. The West Bank also contains a significant section of the western Dead Sea shore. Egypt (; ', , ""Kimi""), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent. A cooperative (also known as co-operative, co-op, or coop) is an autonomous association of people united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled business. Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use their services (a consumer cooperative); by the people who work there (a worker cooperative); by the people who live there (a housing cooperative); hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unions; multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs; and second and third tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives. It was estimated that in 2012 approximately one billion people were members of at least one cooperative and that the turnover of the largest three hundred cooperatives in the world reached $2.2 trillion  which, if they were to be a country, it would make them the seventh largest. ""Palestinian territories"" and ""occupied Palestinian territories"" (OPT or oPt) are descriptions often used to describe the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, which are occupied or otherwise under the control of Israel. Israeli governments have maintained that the area involved is within territorial dispute. The extent of the territories, while subject to future negotiations, have frequently been defined by the Green Line. The seat of government is (as defined by ""Brewer's Politics"") ""the building, complex of buildings or the city from which a government exercises its authority"". The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is ""Middle-Eastern"" and the derived noun is ""Middle-Easterner"".

","Cumbria (; locally ) is a non-metropolitan county in North West England. The county and Cumbria County Council, its local government, came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. Cumbria's county town is Carlisle, in the north of the county, and the only other major urban area is Barrow-in-Furness on the southwestern tip of the county. Carrville is a village in County Durham, in England. It is situated a short distance to the east of Durham, near to Moor End and Belmont. Carrville is part of the Belmont parish. A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the ""de facto"" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. Darlington is a large market town in County Durham, in North East England, and part of the Tees Valley. With a population of 106,000 in 2011, the town lies on the River Skerne, a tributary of the River Tees. The town owes much of its development to the influence of local Quaker families in the Victorian era, and is famous as the terminus of Stockton and Darlington Railway, the world's first passenger railway. The town is often colloquially referred to as 'Darlo'. England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England. A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland. Gateshead is a large town in Tyne and Wear, England, and the main settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. The local authority of Gateshead is also the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. Gateshead lay in the County of County Durham. In 1835 it became part of the Gateshead County Borough. After the Local Government Act 1972, in 1974, Gateshead became part of the Gateshead Metropolitan Borough local authority, and part of the Tyne & Wear Metropolitan County. The town lies on the southern bank of the River Tyne opposite Newcastle upon Tyne. Gateshead and Newcastle are joined by seven bridges across the Tyne, including the Gateshead Millennium Bridge. The town is known for its architecture, including the Sage Gateshead, the Angel of the North and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. Residents of Gateshead, like the rest of Tyneside, are referred to as Geordies. Gateshead's population in 2011 was 120,046. Northumberland is a county in North East England. The northernmost county of England, it borders Cumbria to the west, County Durham and Tyne and Wear to the south and Scotland to the north.

","In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin ""tectonicus"", from the ""pertaining to building"") is a scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of 7 large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the Earth's lithosphere, over the last hundreds of millions of years. The theoretical model builds on the concept of continental drift developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. The geoscientific community accepted plate-tectonic theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. ""Wave motion"" transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations. A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that
The term ""planet"" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain ""planets"" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. Physics (from , from ""phúsis"" ""nature"") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface. Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances. Geophysics is a subject of natural science concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the Earth and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis. The term ""geophysics"" sometimes refers only to the geological applications: Earth's shape; its gravitational and magnetic fields; its internal structure and composition; its dynamics and their surface expression in plate tectonics, the generation of magmas, volcanism and rock formation. However, modern geophysics organizations use a broader definition that includes the water cycle including snow and ice; fluid dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere; electricity and magnetism in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and solar-terrestrial relations; and analogous problems associated with the Moon and other planets. Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or ""gravitate"" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars  and the stars to group together into galaxies  so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better. A magnetosphere is the region of space surrounding an astronomical object in which charged particles are controlled by that object's magnetic field. The magnetic field near the surface of many astronomical objects resembles that of a dipole. The field lines farther away from the surface can be significantly distorted by the flow of electrically conducting plasma emitted from a nearby star (e.g. the solar wind from the Sun). A supernova is an astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion. This causes the sudden appearance of a ""new"" bright star, before slowly fading from sight over several weeks or months.  The zenith is an imaginary point directly ""above"" a particular location, on the imaginary celestial sphere. ""Above"" means in the vertical direction opposite to the apparent gravitational force at that location. The opposite direction, i.e. the direction in which gravity pulls, is toward the nadir. The zenith is the ""highest"" point on the celestial sphere (meaning it is the farthest up from the gravitational force). The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.  Mathematics (from Greek  ""máthma"", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, saline water and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different phases: liquid, solid (ice) and vapor. A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys. The prefix """" refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, FeO. An atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding a planet or other material body, that is held in place by the gravity of that body. An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low. Cosmology (from the Greek , ""kosmos"" ""world"" and -, ""-logia"" ""study of"") is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.  Meteorology is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere. The study of meteorology dates back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data. It wasn't until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and, more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved. Magma (from Ancient Greek  (""mágma"") meaning ""thick unguent"") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. The nadir ( from Arabic :   / ALA - LC : nar , meaning `` opposite '' ) is the direction pointing directly below a particular location ; that is , it is one of two vertical directions at a specified location , orthogonal to a horizontal flat surface there . Since the concept of being below is itself somewhat vague , scientists define the nadir in more rigorous terms . Specifically , in astronomy , geophysics and related sciences ( e.g. , meteorology ) , the nadir at a given point is the local vertical direction pointing in the direction of the force of gravity at that location . The direction opposite of the nadir is the zenith . Nadir also refers to the downward - facing viewing geometry of an orbiting satellite , such as is employed during remote sensing of the atmosphere , as well as when an astronaut faces the Earth while performing a spacewalk . The word is also used figuratively to mean the lowest point of a person 's spirits , or the quality of an activity or profession . The term nadir can also be used to represent the lowest point reached by a celestial body during its apparent orbit around a given point of observation . This can be used to describe the location of the Sun , but it is only technically accurate for one latitude at a time and only possible at the low latitudes . The sun is said to be at the nadir at a location when it is at the zenith at the location 's antipode . In oncology , the term nadir is used to represent the lowest level of a blood cell count while a patient is undergoing chemotherapy . A diagnosis of neutropenic nadir after chemotherapy typically lasts 7 -- 10 days . Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. The ionosphere is a region of Earth's upper atmosphere, from about to altitude, and includes the thermosphere and parts of the mesosphere and exosphere. It is ionized by solar radiation, plays an important part in atmospheric electricity and forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has practical importance because, among other functions, it influences radio propagation to distant places on the Earth. Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will change. A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures."

","Agios Dimitrios ( Greek :   meaning Saint Dimitrios , before 1928 :  - Brachami ) is a suburb in the southern part of the Athens agglomeration , Greece . Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world. Thessaloniki is the second-largest city in Greece and the capital of Greek Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace. Its nickname is   (""Symprotévousa""), literally ""the co-capital"", a reference to its historical status as the  (""Symvasilévousa"") or ""co-reigning"" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople. Piraeus (""Pireás"" , , ""Peiraieús"") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. Plato (Greek: ""Plátn"", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire ""œuvre"" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the ""mother city"" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation. Athens (""Athína"" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. The 5th century BC started the first day of 500 BC and ended the last day of 401 BC. Aristotle (""Aristotéls""; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. Philosophy (from Greek , ""philosophia"", literally ""love of wisdom"") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas ("""" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. 
Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.

Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny. The uterus, also known as the womb, is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ in humans and most other mammals. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. The nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils and is responsible for respiration. Altricial species are those whose young are incapable of moving around on their own soon after birth or hatching. Mammals are vertebrates with specific characteristics such as a neocortex, hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands. The skeleton provides support and protection to the body, while muscles enable movement and maintain posture. Joints connect bones and allow for movement. Birth, or parturition, is the process of bringing forth offspring, which in mammals is initiated by hormones. Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside the female's uterus. Cartilage is a resilient tissue that forms a part of the skeletal system. Hormones are signaling molecules that regulate physiology and behavior. White blood cells are involved in protecting the body against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. Bones are rigid organs that constitute part of the vertebrate skeleton, providing support, protection, and enabling movement. The ear is the organ of hearing and balance in mammals.

","Helsinki City Transport or HKL (Finnish: ""Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos"", Swedish: ""Helsingfors stads trafikverk"", abbreviated ""HST"") is the official city-owned public transport company in Helsinki, Finland. It operates the Helsinki metro, Helsinki tram and ferry boat traffic. Its bus operations were merged with another city-owned company, Suomen Turistiauto, to form a new bus company called Helsingin Bussiliikenne. Until the beginning January 2000, HKL was responsible for planning and organising all public transport in Helsinki. After that date Helsingin seudun liikenne (HSL) took over these responsibilities. Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow. Uusimaa or Nyland (both names mean new land) is a region in Finland. It borders the regions Southwest Finland, Tavastia Proper, Päijänne Tavastia and Kymenlaakso. Finlands capital Helsinki (its largest city) and its second largest city Espoo are both located centrally in Uusimaa, making it by far the most populous region. A boat is a watercraft of a large range of sizes designed to float, plane, work or travel on water. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways (e.g., rivers and lakes) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation from a ship in an offshore environment. In naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters long on the Great Lakes are called oreboats. For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as 'boats' rather than 'ships', regardless of their size and shape. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity.  The Helsinki tram network forms part of the Helsinki public transport system organised by Helsinki Regional Transport Authority and operated by Helsinki City Transport ( Finnish : Helsingin kaupungin liikenne , Swedish : Helsingfors stads trafikverk ) in the Finnish capital city of Helsinki .

Munich (also in British English ) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Bavaria, on the banks of River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps. Munich is the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and the 12th biggest city of the European Union, with a population of above 1.5 million. The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 5.8 million people. The 1972 Summer Olympics (German: ""Olympische Sommerspiele 1972""), officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in Munich, West Germany, from August 26 to September 11, 1972. International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country. West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or ""RFA"") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as ""Germany"". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (""Bonner Republik"") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic."
169,What is the parent taxon of Dromiacea?,brachyura,"['animal', 'brachyura', 'hermit', 'human', 'insects', 'king crab', 'mya', 'paralithodes', 'thorax', 'tortoise', 'xiphosura']"," Melrose Place is an American primetime soap opera that aired on Fox from 1992 to 1999. The show follows the lives of a group of young adults living in an apartment complex called Melrose Place, in West Hollywood, California. Created by Darren Star and executive produced by Aaron Spelling, it is the second series in the ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" franchise.

The show initially aired on Wednesday at 9pm, after ""Beverly Hills, 90210"". In 1994, it moved to Monday at 8pm for its third season. Bob Daily, an executive producer of ""Desperate Housewives"", and John Pardee, an executive producer of the same show, were among the executive producers of Melrose Place.

Doug Savant played the character Tom Scavo in ""Desperate Housewives"". He was originally a recurring character in the first season but became a regular in season two. Tom's storylines often revolve around his working habits and being away from the family. However, a turning point occurred in season three, where Tom's storylines often revolve around his insecurity about his life, mid-life crisis, and depression.

Melrose Place was a popular show during its run, and its success led to the creation of ""Desperate Housewives"", which aired from 2004 to 2012. Marc Cherry, the creator of ""Desperate Housewives"", served as the showrunner for the series. Other executive producers for ""Desperate Housewives"" included Bob Daily, John Pardee, and several others. ","Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting ""tail"" (abdomen) (= short, = tail), usually entirely hidden under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and have a single pair of claws. Many other animals with similar names  such as hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, horseshoe crabs, and crab lice  are not true crabs. King crabs are a superfamily of crab-like decapod crustaceans chiefly found in cold seas. Because of their large size and the taste of their meat, many species are widely caught and sold as food, the most common being the red king crab (""Paralithodes camtschaticus""). Raninoida is a taxonomic section of the crabs, containing a single superfamily, Raninoidea. This group of crabs is unlike most, with the abdomen not being folded under the thorax. It comprises 46 extant species, and nearly 200 species known only from fossils. Hermit crabs are decapod crustaceans of the superfamily Paguroidea. An exoskeleton (from Greek , ""éx"" ""outer"" and , ""skeletos"" ""skeleton"") is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as ""shells"". Examples of animals with exoskeletons include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of certain sponges and the various groups of shelled molluscs, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons. Some animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton. The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as ""caudate"" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective ""caudal"". In some taxonomic systems, Podotremata is the smaller of the two sections making up the crabs (Brachyura). Morphological and molecular analyses do not reveal a monophyletic Podotremata, and so the most recent classifications divide ""Podotremata"" into three sections: Dromiacea, Cyclodorippoidea and Raninoida. The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. Dromiacea is a group of crabs , ranked as a section . It contains 240 extant and nearly 300 extinct species . Where they are considered to form a monophyletic group , Dromiacea and two other groups of crabs , namely the Raninoida and Cyclodorippoidea , may be collected together into the Podotremata , each at the rank of subsection ; morphological and molecular evidence argue against such a grouping . The larvae of Dromiacea resemble those of the Anomura more closely than those of other crabs . This may simply reflect their basal position in the crab phylogeny . The fossil record of Dromiacea reaches back at least as far as the Jurassic , and , if Imocaris is indeed a member , into the Carboniferous . The superfamily Eocarcinoidea , containing Eocarcinus and Platykotta , was previously considered to be a member of the Dromiacea , but has since been transferred to the Anomura . Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods of the family Limulidae and order Xiphosura or Xiphosurida, that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms. They occasionally come onto shore to mate. They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer. In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in Japan and overharvesting along the east coast of North America. Tetrodotoxin may be present in the roe of species inhabiting the waters of Thailand. Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils. The thorax or chest (from the Greek  ""thorax"" ""breastplate, cuirass, corslet"" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain."

","In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. iovo (pronounced ) is a small island located off the Adriatic coast in Croatia with an area of (length , width up to ), population of 5,908 inhabitants (2011) and its highest peak is 218 m (Rudine). The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. Trogir (Ancient Greek: , ""Tragyrion"" or , ""Tragourion"" ""Trogkir"") is a historic town and harbour on the Adriatic coast in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia, with a population of 10,818 (2011) and a total municipality population of 13,260 (2011). The historic city of Trogir is situated on a small island between the Croatian mainland and the island of iovo. It lies west of the city of Split. A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word ""castle"", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence  though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace. Kamerlengo ( Gradina Kamerlengo ) is a castle and fortress in Trogir , Croatia . It was built by the Republic of Venice The castle was built in the mid- 15th century by Marin Radoj as part of an expansion of the Veriga Tower , built on the site in the late 14th century . It is used as a location for performances during the summer months . The word kamerlengo ( Italian : camerlengo ) refers to the title of a Venetian administrative official ( a chamberlain ) . Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as ""lo Stivale"" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is ""Middle-Eastern"" and the derived noun is ""Middle-Easterner"". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. Venice (; ) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges. These are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site. Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora. A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. The Republic of Venice, or traditionally known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice, was a state originating from the lagoon communities in the area of Venice, now northeastern Italy. It existed from the late seventh century AD until 1797. Although it had a long history of war and conquest, the republic's modern reputation is chiefly based on its status as an economic and trading power. An arrowslit (often also referred to as an arrow loop, loophole or loop hole, and sometimes a balistraria) is a thin vertical aperture in a fortification through which an archer can launch arrows. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. Split-Dalmatia County is the central-southern Dalmatian county in Croatia. The administrative center is Split. The population of the county is 455,242 (2011). The land area is 4540 km. Most Serene Republic (""Serenissima Respublica"" in Latin) is a title attached to a number of European states through history. By custom, the appellation ""Most Serene"" is an indicator of sovereignty (see also Serene Highness or Most Serene Highness for a sovereign prince); consequently ""Most Serene Republic"" emphasizes the sovereignty of the republic. ""Country House"" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth album ""The Great Escape"" on 14 August 1995.

The battle took place near the town of Battle, East Sussex, and resulted in a decisive Norman victory led by William, the Duke of Normandy, over the Anglo-Saxon forces under King Harold II. This victory led to the Norman conquest of England and the end of Anglo-Saxon rule.

The battle site, located in the designated High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, is now a popular tourist attraction. The town of Battle, with a population of 6,673 according to the 2011 Census, is home to two senior schools and is a historic town with a rich heritage.

The Battle of Hastings re-enactment in 2000 attracted over 1,500 participants from 16 different countries, highlighting the global interest in this pivotal event. The next major re-enactment took place in 2006, further cementing the battle's significance in history.

Normandy, a region in France, was the homeland of William, the Duke of Normandy, who later became William I of England. The Norman conquest of England, which began with the Battle of Hastings, had a profound impact on the country's culture, language, and governance.

The battle site near Battle, East Sussex, remains a symbol of the Norman conquest and a reminder of the significant changes that took place in England in 1066.

Over the course of 38 years, he has created more than 90 works of art, with his films being showcased in prestigious venues such as the Pompidou Center Paris, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) New York, the Lincoln Center New York, and the British Film Institute London.

Gitai's work has been recognized with numerous awards, including seven entries in the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or category and the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion award between 1999 and 2011. He has collaborated with renowned actors such as Juliette Binoche, Natalie Portman, and Hanna Schygulla, and has worked with French filmmaker Marie-José Sanselme since 2000.

Amos Gitai's film ""Alila"" (2003) follows six diverse characters in modern-day Israel, allowing him to comment on the country's top social issues. The film received mixed reviews, with some praising its boldness and entertainment value, while others criticized its lack of likable characters and the director's jaundiced view of humanity.

Alekan's work contributed to the visual storytelling of Gitai's films, helping to bring his unique perspective on the Middle East and its conflicts to life on the screen. ","Spiritualism is the belief that the spirits of the dead have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living. The afterlife, or the ""spirit world"", is seen by spiritualists, not as a static place, but as one in which spirits continue to evolve. These two beliefs: that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits are more advanced than humans, lead spiritualists to a third belief, that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about the nature of God. Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as ""spirit guides""specific spirits, often contacted, who are relied upon for spiritual guidance. Spiritism, a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America, especially in Brazil, emphasizes reincarnation. The New Age is a term applied to a range of spiritual or religious beliefs and practices that developed in Western nations during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of ""spiritual"" and rarely use the term ""New Age"" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term, believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon.
As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought, and the Theosophical Society. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age movement. Although the exact origins of the movement remain contested, it is agreed that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States.
Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age movement have been identified. Theologically, the movement typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity which imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming Age of Aquarius, from which the movement gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of alternative medicine, and an emphasis on a ""New Age science"" which seeks to unite science and spirituality.
Those involved in the New Age movement have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the movement varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The movement has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as contemporary Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the movement became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies. The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, """"The New Age"" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922"". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with ""The New English Weekly"" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934). Emanuel Swedenborg (born Emanuel Swedberg on 29 January 1688; died 29 March 1772) was a Swedish scientist, philosopher, theologian, revelator, and mystic. He is best known for his book on the afterlife, ""Heaven and Hell"" (1758).

Elizabeth , just 33 years of age at the time of husband Mark 's death on February 26 , 1973 , assumed control of The Summit Lighthouse at that time . In 1975 , Prophet founded Church Universal and Triumphant , which became the umbrella organization for the movement , and which she expanded worldwide . Prophet controversially called on her members in the late 1980s to prepare for the possibility of nuclear war at the turn of the decade , encouraging them to construct fallout shelters . In 1996 , Prophet handed day - to - day operational control of her organization to a president and board of directors , maintaining her role as spiritual leader until her retirement due to health reasons in 1999 . During the 1980s and 1990s , Prophet appeared on Larry King Live , Donahue and Nightline , among other television programs . Earlier media appearances included a feature in 1977 in `` The Man Who Would Not Die , '' an episode of NBC 's In Search Of ... series . She was also featured in 1994 on NBC 's Ancient Prophecies . Franz Friedrich Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734  March 5, 1815) was a German physician with an interest in astronomy, who theorised that there was a natural energetic transference that occurred between all animated and inanimate objects that he called animal magnetism, sometimes later referred to as ""mesmerism"". The theory attracted a wide following between about 1780 and 1850, and continued to have some influence until the end of the century. In 1843 the Scottish physician James Braid proposed the term hypnosis for a technique derived from animal magnetism; today this is the usual meaning of ""mesmerism""."

It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. The islands were named after Queen Mariana by Spaniards, who first arrived in the early 16th century and who eventually annexed and colonized the archipelago. The indigenous inhabitants are the Chamorro people. Archaeologists in 2013 reported findings which indicated the people who first settled the Marianas arrived there after making what was at that time the longest uninterrupted ocean voyage in human history. They further reported findings which suggested that Tinian is likely to have been the first island in Oceania to have been settled by humans.

Wigtownshire was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. It was represented by one Member of Parliament. Hew Hamilton Dalrymple, the son of John Dalrymple, 10th Earl of Stair, won the seat at a by-election in 1915 and held it until it was abolished in 1918.

The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favor of a single parliament located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This arrangement lasted nearly a century until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom, effective from 1 January 1801.

Scotland is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, Scotland is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. ","The Republic of Iceland, ""Lýðveldið Ísland"" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. Old Norse poetry encompasses a range of verse forms written in Old Norse, during the period from the 8th century (see Eggjum stone) to as late as the far end of the 13th century. Most of the Old Norse poetry that survives was preserved in Iceland, but there are also 122 preserved poems in Swedish rune inscriptions, 54 in Norwegian and 12 in Danish. Ynglinga saga is a legendary saga, originally written in Old Norse by the Icelandic poet and historian Snorri Sturluson about 1225. It is the first section of his ""Heimskringla"". It was first translated into English and published in 1844 by Samuel Laing. The second part of Snorri Sturluson's ""Prose Edda"" the Skáldskaparmál ([skaldskaparmal], , ""language of poetry""; c. 50,000 words) is effectively a dialogue between Ægir, the Norse god of the sea, and Bragi, the god of poetry, in which both Norse mythology and discourse on the nature of poetry are intertwined. The origin of a number of ""kennings"" is given; then Bragi delivers a systematic list of ""kennings"" for various people, places and things. He then goes on to discuss poetic language in some detail, in particular ""heiti"", the concept of poetical words which are non-periphrastic (like ""steed"" for ""horse""), and again systematises these. This in a way forms an early form of poetic thesaurus. Heimskringla is the best known of the Old Norse kings' sagas. It was written in Old Norse in Iceland by the poet and historian Snorri Sturluson (1178/791241) ca. 1230. The name ""Heimskringla"" was first used in the 17th century, derived from the first two words of one of the manuscripts (""kringla heimsins"" - ""the circle of the world""). An eponym is a person, place, or thing for whom or for which something is named, or believed to be named. For example, Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era. The Háttatal (""conversation of meters""; c. 20,000 words) is the last section of the ""Prose Edda"" composed by the Icelandic poet, politician, and historian Snorri Sturluson. Using, for the most part, his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, and often notes that ""the older poets did not always"" follow his rules. The Alþingi (anglicised as or ) is the national parliament of Iceland. It is one of the oldest extant parliamentary institutions in the world.
The Althing was founded in 930 at , the ""assembly fields"" or ""Parliament fields"", situated approximately east of what later became the country's capital, Reykjavík. This event marked the beginning of the Icelandic Commonwealth. Even after Iceland's union with Norway in 1262, the Althing still held its sessions at until 1799, when it was discontinued for 45 years. It was restored in 1844 and moved to Reykjavík, where it has resided ever since. The present parliament building, the , was built in 1881, of hewn Icelandic stone. Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. The term skald or skáld, meaning poet, is generally used for poets who composed at the courts of Scandinavian and Icelandic leaders during the Viking Age and Middle Ages. Skaldic poetry forms one of two main groupings of Old Norse poetry, the other being the anonymous Eddic poetry. The Viking Age is the period from late 8th century to mid 11th century in European history, especially Northern European and Scandinavian history, following the Germanic Iron Age. It is the period of history when Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonisation and conquest. In this period, the Norsemen settled in Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, and present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, England, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey. Though Viking travellers and colonists were seen at many points in history as brutal raiders, many historical documents suggest that their invasion of other countries was retaliation in response to the encroachment upon tribal lands by Christian missionaries, and perhaps by the Saxon Wars prosecuted by Charlemagne and his kin to the south, or, were motivated by overpopulation, trade inequities, and the lack of viable farmland in their homeland. Information about the Viking Age is drawn largely from what was written about the Vikings by their enemies, and primary sources of archaeology, supplied with secondary sources like the Icelandic Sagas. Sagas are stories mostly about ancient Nordic and Germanic history, about early Viking voyages, the battles that took place during the voyages, about migration to Iceland and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland. Gylfaginning ([glvagng] either ""Tricking of Gylfi"" or ""Gylfi's empowerment""; c. 20,000 words), is the first part of Snorri Sturluson's ""Prose Edda"" after Prologue. The ""Gylfaginning"" deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the Norse gods, and many other aspects of Norse mythology. The second part of the Prose Edda is called the ""Skáldskaparmál"" and the third ""Háttatal"". A lawspeaker or lawman (Swedish: ""lagman"", Old Swedish: ""laghmaþer"" or ""laghman"", Danish: ""lovsigemand"", Norwegian: ""lagmann"", Icelandic: ""lög(sögu)maður"", Faroese: ""løgmaður"", Finnish: ""laamanni"") is a unique Scandinavian legal office. It has its basis in a common Germanic oral tradition, where wise men were asked to recite the law, but it was only in Scandinavia that the function evolved into an office. Two of the most famous lawspeakers are Snorri Sturluson and Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker. Egil 's Saga ( listen ) is an Icelandic saga . The oldest transcript ( a fragment ) dates back to 1240 AD . The saga is centered on the life of Egill Skallagrímsson , also known as Egil Skallagrimsson , an Icelandic farmer , viking and skald . It is generally referred to as Egla by Icelandic scholars . The saga is the only source of information on the exploits of Egill whose life is not historically recorded . Stylistic and other similarities between Egil 's Saga and Heimskringla have led many scholars to believe that they were the work of the same author , Snorri Sturluson . Snorri Sturluson (1179  23 September 1241) was an Icelandic historian, poet, and politician. He was elected twice as lawspeaker at the Icelandic parliament, the Althing. He was the author of the ""Prose Edda"" or ""Younger Edda"", which consists of ""Gylfaginning"" (""the fooling of Gylfi""), a narrative of Norse mythology, the ""Skáldskaparmál"", a book of poetic language, and the ""Háttatal"", a list of verse forms. He was also the author of the ""Heimskringla"", a history of the Norwegian kings that begins with legendary material in ""Ynglinga saga"" and moves through to early medieval Scandinavian history. For stylistic and methodological reasons, Snorri is often taken to be the author of ""Egil's saga"". Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during about the 9th to 13th centuries. A protagonist is the main character in any story, such as a literary work or drama. Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. Egill Skallagrímsson (c. 904c. 995) was a Viking-Age poet, warrior and farmer. He is also the protagonist of the eponymous ""Egil's Saga"". ""Egil's Saga"" historically narrates a period from approximately 850 to 1000 CE and is believed to have been written between 1220 and 1240 CE. The Prose Edda, also known as the Younger Edda, Snorri's Edda or, historically, simply as Edda, is an Old Norse work of literature written in Iceland in the early 13th century. The work is often assumed to have been written, or at least compiled, by the Icelandic scholar and historian Snorri Sturluson around the year 1220."

It is not a strict musical genre ""per se"", since the specific sounds can vary wildly (from Cornershop's Bollywood-influenced Britpop to Panjabi MCs' bhangra-influenced jungle). Most of these artists are the children or grandchildren of immigrants and have grown up in Western culture, but still have a strong Asian background through their families."

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population.

It has a population of  A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. The Ngawha geothermal field is a geothermal area in the North Island of New Zealand . It is situated approximately 5 km east of Kaikohe and is centred on the village of Ngawha Springs . The field covers an area of around 25 km² and as such , is much smaller than the only other geothermal field in New Zealand , the Taupo Volcanic Zone . The hot springs arising in this area are slightly acidic and are rich in ammonia , bicarbonate , boron and mercury , which is not typical of other springs in New Zealand . A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a ""town"" varies considerably in different parts of the world. The Tasman Sea (Mori: ""Te Tai-o-Rehua"") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.

This action, taken with the consent of the United Kingdom as per the Quebec Agreement, resulted in the deaths of at least 129,000 people. The bombings were part of the final stage of World War II, a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945 and involved over 30 countries. The war was characterized by mass civilian casualties, including the Holocaust, which saw the systematic murder of approximately six million Jews, including 1.5 million children.

The Battle of Maastricht was a key engagement during the German Campaign on the Western Front. The objective was to capture the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael, a neutralized fortress that had been taken by glider-borne German troops in May 1940. The fort's capture was crucial for the Germans to advance into Belgium and split the Allied forces.

Fort Eben-Emael, located between Liège and Maastricht on the Belgian-Dutch border, was constructed between 1931 and 1935 and was considered impregnable at the time. The successful neutralization of the fort by the Germans paved the way for their ground forces to enter Belgium without facing fire from the fort. The fort has since been preserved and is open for public visitation.

In summary, the United States' use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Battle of Maastricht, and the capture of Fort Eben-Emael were significant events during World War II. The war resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in human history. The Holocaust, a genocide carried out by Nazi Germany, claimed the lives of six million Jews and five million non-Jewish victims. ","Fortran (formerly FORTRAN, derived from ""Formula Translation"") is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and fourth-generation programming language. A proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python. The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology. jLab is a numerical computational environment implemented in Java . The main scripting engine of jLab is GroovySci , an extension of Groovy . Additionally , the interpreted J - Scripts ( similar to MATLAB ) and dynamic linking to Java class code are supported . The jLab environment aims to provide a MATLAB / Scilab like scientific computing platform that is supported by scripting engines implemented in the Java language . In the current implementation of jLab there coexist two scripting engines : the interpreted j - Script scripting engine and the compiled Groovy scripting engine . The later ( i.e. Groovy ) seems to be the preferred choice , since it is much faster , can execute directly Java code using only the familiar Java packaging rules , and is feature - rich language , i.e. Groovy enhanced with MATLAB style matrix operations and surrounding support environment .

C++ (pronounced ""cee plus plus"") is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. A fourth-generation programming language (4GL) is a computer programming language envisioned as a refinement of the style of languages classified as third-generation programming language (3GL). Each of the programming language generations aims to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details, making the language more programmer-friendly, powerful and versatile. While the definition of 3GL has changed over time, it can be typified by operating more with large collections of information at once rather than focusing on just bits and bytes. Languages claimed to be 4GL may include support for database management, report generation, mathematical optimization, GUI development, or web development. Some researchers state that 4GLs are a subset of domain-specific languages."

Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.

193,Where did Amir Pnueli pass away?,new york city,"['new york city', 'york']"," The infantry tank was a concept developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. These tanks were designed to support infantry soldiers in an attack by providing heavy armor to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. It was armed with the 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an 87.6 mm (3.45 in) 11.5 kg (25 lb) HE shell or an armor-piercing shell. However, the Bishop was a rushed attempt to create a self-propelled gun and had numerous problems. It was produced in limited numbers and soon replaced by better designs.

Another example of an infantry tank was the Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be both strong and reliable. Over 8,000 of the type were produced in eleven marks, plus various specialized variants, accounting for approximately a quarter of wartime British tank production.

Many famous Minamoto warriors, including Minamoto no Yoshiie, Minamoto no Yoritomo, and Ashikaga Takauji, belonged to this lineage. Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, also claimed descent from this lineage.

The Itakura clan was closely associated with the Tsuchiya clan, with whom they served loyally for many years. The Shimazu and Tokugawa clans also claimed to belong to this lineage. The Itakura clan's history and connections to other powerful clans played a significant role in shaping the political landscape of Japan during the Edo period.

Adandozan was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1797 until 1818. His rule ended with a coup by his brother Ghezo who then erased Adandozan from the official history resulting in high uncertainty about many aspects of his life. Adandozan took over from his father Agonglo in 1797 but was quite young at the time and so there was a regent in charge of the kingdom until 1804. Dealing with the economic depression that had defined the administrations of his father Agonglo and grandfather Kpengla, Adandozan tried to increase slave raiding, increase European trade, and when these failed reform the economy to focus on agriculture. Unfortunately, these efforts did not end domestic dissent and in 1818 at the Annual Customs of Dahomey, Ghezo and Francisco Félix de Sousa, a powerful Brazilian slave trader, organized a coup d'état and replaced Adandozan. He was left alive and lived until the 1860s hidden in the palaces while he was largely erased from official royal history.

This family used to include genera like Atrax, which are now classified under the Hexathelidae family. Atrax, specifically the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus""), is a venomous spider found in eastern Australia. Its bite can cause serious injury or death in humans if left untreated. However, modern first aid techniques and antivenom have prevented fatalities.

The Theraphosidae family, commonly known as tarantulas, comprises around 900 species of large and often hairy arachnids. While some species can cause severe allergic reactions, they are not generally dangerous to humans. The Atracinae subfamily, also known as Australian funnel-web spiders, consists of three genera: Atrax, Hadronyche, and Illawarra, with 35 species. Six of these species produce venom that can cause severe injuries to humans.

The Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea. Despite their impressive size, these spiders are shy and there are no records of them biting humans. The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathelena hochstetteri) is a large spider native to New Zealand, and it is not known to bite humans.

In summary, the Dipluridae family includes venomous spiders like the Sydney funnel-web spider, which can cause serious harm to humans if bitten. However, modern first aid techniques and antivenom have made fatalities rare. The Theraphosidae family, which includes tarantulas, is not generally dangerous to humans, and the Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is not known to bite humans.

The Adirondack Park Agency (APA) was created in 1971 by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a governmental agency that performs long-range planning for the future of the Adirondack Park. It oversees development plans of private land-owners as well as activities within the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Development by private owners must be reviewed to determine if their plan is compatible with the park. The agency is headquartered in Ray Brook, New York.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. 
In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called ""in-holdings"" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. 
Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world. Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: ""The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.""

Biliran is one of the country's smallest and newest provinces. Formerly a sub-province of Leyte, it became an independent province in 1992. ""Do the Reggay"" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. ""Do the Reggay"" was the first popular song to use the word ""reggae"" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, ""reggay"" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. Quezon City (  also known as QC) is the most populous city in the Philippines. It is one of the cities that make up Metro Manila, the National Capital Region of the Philippines. Quezon City was named after Manuel L. Quezon, second President of the Philippines, who founded the city and developed it to replace Manila as the national capital for 28 years from 1948 to 1976. Quezon City is not located in and should not be confused with Quezon Province, which was also named after the president. It is the largest city in Metro Manila in terms of land area and most populated local government unit in the country. Studio 23 (officially Studio 23, Inc. and previously AMCARA Broadcasting Network) was a Filipino television network owned by ABS-CBN Corporation.

204,During which historical period did Clinomachus belong to?,megarian school,"['classical period', 'megarian school', 'renaissance']"," The Mazarinettes were a group of seven nieces of Cardinal Mazarin, the Chief Minister of France during the reign of King Louis XIV. The Mazarinettes were brought to France from Italy in 1647 and 1653 to secure advantageous marriages with powerful and influential French and Italian princes. To overcome aristocratic resistance, Cardinal Mazarin generously granted large dowries to the fiancés.

Anna Maria (Marie) Mancini, born on August 28, 1639, and died on May 8, 1715, was one of the five Mancini sisters and the third of the Mazarinettes. Along with two of her female Martinozzi cousins, the Mancini sisters were known at the French court as the Mazarinettes.

Jules Raymond Mazarin, born on July 14, 1602, and died on March 9, 1661, was an Italian cardinal, diplomat, and politician who served as the Chief Minister to the King of France from 1642 until his death. He was responsible for bringing the Mazarinettes to France and arranging their advantageous marriages.

Antoine Baudeau, born around 1630, was a secretary to Marie Mancini and published a Grand Dictionnaire des Prétieuses in 1660 and a comedy, Le Procez des prétieuses, in the same year.

A chief minister is the elected head of government of a sub-national entity, such as a province, state, territory, or autonomous region. Examples include the Chief Minister of the provinces in Nepal, the Governor of the states in India, the Premier of the territories in Australia, the Chief Ministers of the provinces in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the Chief Ministers of the Philippine autonomous regions, and the Chief Ministers of British Overseas Territories that have attained self-governance. The title is also used for the heads of governments of the Malay states without a monarchy. ","In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. The Megarian school of philosophy, which flourished in the 4th century BC, was founded by Euclides of Megara, one of the pupils of Socrates. Its ethical teachings were derived from Socrates, recognizing a single good, which was apparently combined with the Eleatic doctrine of Unity. Some of Euclides' successors developed logic to such an extent that they became a separate school, known as the Dialectical school. Their work on modal logic, logical conditionals, and propositional logic played an important role in the development of logic in antiquity. Euclid of Megara (also Euclides, Eucleides c. 435  c. 365 BCE) was a Greek Socratic philosopher who founded the Megarian school of philosophy. He was a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE, and was present at his death. He held the supreme good to be one, eternal and unchangeable, and denied the existence of anything contrary to the good. Editors and translators in the Middle Ages often confused him with Euclid of Alexandria when discussing the latter's ""Elements"". Pyrrho (""Pyrrn"", c. 360 BC  c. 270 BC), was a Greek philosopher of Classical Antiquity and is credited as being the first Greek skeptic philosopher. Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and Southwestern Asia. Clinomachus ( Greek :  ; 4th - century BCE ) , was a Megarian philosopher from Thurii . He is said by Diogenes Laërtius to have been the first who composed treatises on the fundamental principles of dialectics , and he is described as the founder of the Dialectical school . According to the Suda , he was the disciple of Euclid of Megara , and he taught Bryson , the teacher of Pyrrho . He thus lived towards the earlier half of the 4th century BC."

Curse of the Queerwolf, directed by Mark Pirro, features Michael Palazzolo and Kent Butler in a comedy horror setting. The Cabin in the Woods, directed by Drew Goddard and produced by Joss Whedon, stars Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, and others.

Both films follow a group of college students who retreat to a remote forest cabin, only to find themselves in the midst of supernatural horrors. In Curse of the Queerwolf, the students encounter backwoods zombies, while in The Cabin in the Woods, the students fall victim to zombies and technicians manipulating events from an underground facility.

Black comedy and dark comedy are comic styles that make light of serious or taboo subjects. Comedy horror, a genre that combines elements of comedy and horror fiction, can be categorized into black comedy, parody, and spoof. These films often use satire on horror cliches as their main source of humor or take a story in a different perspective.

The Cabin in the Woods, in particular, is a modern example of comedy horror that uses satire to comment on horror cliches. The film's plot revolves around the group of college students and their interactions with the technicians, who are revealed to be manipulating the events for their own purposes. The film's dark humor and clever twists make it a standout example of the genre.

In conclusion, Curse of the Queerwolf and The Cabin in the Woods are two comedy horror films that blend humor and horror elements to create unique and entertaining experiences for audiences.

The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Pseudorthocerida is an order of generally straight longiconic Orthoceratoids with a subcentral to marginal cyrtochoanitic siphuncle composed of variably expanded segments which may contain internal deposits that may develop into a continuous parietal lining.(Sweet 1964). Cameral deposits are common and concentrated ventrally. Apices typically have a slight to moderate exogastric curvature  The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46.7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 252.2 Mya. It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm. Arkansas is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Its name is of Siouan derivation from the language of the Osage denoting their related kin, the Quapaw Indians. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta. The Arkansas Delta is one of the six natural regions of the state of Arkansas. Willard B. Gatewood Jr., author of ""The Arkansas Delta: Land of Paradox"", says that rich cotton lands of the Arkansas Delta make that area ""The Deepest of the Deep South."" In the context of human society, a family (from ) is a group of people affiliated either by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage or any other relationship like siblings families etc..), or co-residence (as implied by the etymology of the English word ""family"") 
or some combination of these. Members of the immediate family include spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons, and/or daughters. Members of the extended family may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and/or siblings-in-law. Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them. Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , ""kephalópoda""; ""head-feet""). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology. Carbactinoceratidae is a family of extinct cephalopods with external shells that lived around 325 million years ago , during the Carboniferous period . They were the last group of orthocones to attain sizes exceeding one meter ( three feet ) in length . One specimen of the carbactinoceratid species Rayonnoceras solidiforme , recently found in Arkansas , was measured at 2.5 metres ( 8.2 ft ) long . Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or ritually recognized union between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws. The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a cultural universal.
Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal, emotional, financial, spiritual, and religious purposes. Whom they marry may be influenced by socially determined rules of incest, prescriptive marriage rules, parental choice and individual desire. In some areas of the world, arranged marriage, child marriage, polygamy, and sometimes forced marriage, may be practiced as a cultural tradition. Conversely, such practices may be outlawed and penalized in parts of the world out of concerns for women's rights and because of international law. In developed parts of the world, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights within marriage for women and legally recognizing the marriages of interfaith or interracial, and same-sex couples. These trends coincide with the broader human rights movement. Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million. The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied.
The first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the ""Age of Fish"". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name ""Carboniferous"" means ""coal-bearing"" and derives from the Latin words ""carb"" (""coal"") and ""fer"" (""I bear, I carry""), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. The Arkansas Timberlands (sometimes also called Southern Arkansas or Southwest Arkansas) is a region of the U.S. state of Arkansas generally encompassing the area south of the Ouachita Mountains, south of Central Arkansas and west of the Arkansas Delta. With several different definitions in use by various state agencies, the Arkansas Timberlands is essentially a region known for dense pine and cypress forests covering hilly terrain and lining numerous rivers. Modern settlement created a significant logging industry and subsequent clearance agriculture which provided the basis of the local economy until the discovery of petroleum. Local tourism is largely based on the popularity of deer hunting and bass fishing. Attractions there include Marks' Mills Battleground Historical Monument, Jenkins' Ferry Battleground Historical Monument, Overflow National Wildlife Refuge, Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge, South Arkansas Arboretum, Arkansas Museum of Natural Resources, White Oak Lake State Park, Poison Springs Battleground State Park, Millwood State Park, and Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge. The Arkansas Timberlands was the birthplace of former President of the United States Bill Clinton.

","A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although ""historian"" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience.

The North Aegean is one of the thirteen regions of Greece. It comprises the islands of the north-eastern Aegean Sea, except for Samothrace, which belongs to the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. Athens (""Athína"" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. The History of the Peloponnesian War (Greek: """") is a historical account of the Peloponnesian War (431404 BC), which was fought between the Peloponnesian League (led by Sparta) and the Delian League (led by Athens). It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian historian who also happened to serve as an Athenian general during the war. His account of the conflict is widely considered to be a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The ""History"" is divided into eight books. Argos (Modern Greek:  ; Ancient Greek:  ) is a city in Argolis, Peloponnese, Greece and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is also a former bishopric and present Latin Catholic titular see. It is the biggest town in Argolis and a major center for the area.
Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138 km. It is from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years. The city is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network. Lesbos, sometimes referred to as ""Mytilini"" after its capital, is a Greek island located in the northeastern Aegean Sea. It has an area of with of coastline, making it the third largest island in Greece. It is separated from Turkey by the narrow Mytilini Strait and in late Palaeolithic/Mesolithic times was joined to the Anatolian mainland before the end of the last glacial period. Thucydides (""Thoukudíds"", ; c. 460  c. 400 BC) was an Athenian historian and general. His ""History of the Peloponnesian War"" recounts the 5th century BC war between Sparta and Athens to the year 411 BC. Thucydides has been dubbed the father of ""scientific history"" because of his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work. Mytilene ("""" ) is an ancient city founded in the 11th century BC. Mytilene is the capital and port of the island of Lesbos and also the capital of the North Aegean Region. The seat of governor of the North Aegean Region is Mytilene. Mytilene is also one of 13 municipalities (counties) on the island of Lesbos. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a metropolitan bishop of the Orthodox church. The Corinthian War was an ancient Greek conflict lasting from 395 BC until 387 BC, pitting Sparta against a coalition of four allied states, Thebes, Athens, Corinth, and Argos, who were initially backed by Persia. The immediate cause of the war was a local conflict in northwest Greece in which both Thebes and Sparta intervened. The deeper cause was hostility towards Sparta provoked by that city's ""expansionism in Asia Minor, central and northern Greece and even the west"". Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. Lesbonax , of Mytilene , Greek sophist and rhetorician , flourished in the time of Caesar Augustus . According to Photius I of Constantinople he was the author of sixteen political speeches , of which two are extant , a hortatory speech after the style of Thucydides , and a speech on the Corinthian War . In the first he exhorts the Athenians against the Spartans , in the second ( the title of which is misleading ) against the Thebans ( edition by F. Kiehr , Lesbonactis sophistae quae supersunt ( Leipzig 1906 ) . Some erotic letters are also attributed to him . His son Potamo was also a notable rhetorician .

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a biopolymer composed of nucleotides, which are made up of a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA was determined through X-ray diffraction studies conducted by Rosalind Franklin, who passed away before the Nobel Prize was awarded.

Francis Crick and James Watson, both British scientists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on DNA was crucial in the discovery of the double helix structure, but she was not recognized with a Nobel Prize due to her untimely death in 1958.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine.

","Lutzomyia is a genus of phlebotomine sand flies consisting of nearly 400 species, at least 33 of which have medical importance as vectors of human disease. Species of the genus ""Lutzomyia"" are found only in the New World, distributed in southern areas of the Nearctic and throughout the Neotropic zone. ""Lutzomyia"" is one of the two genera of the subfamily Phlebotominae to transmit the Leishmania parasite, with the other being ""Phlebotomus"", found only in the Old World. ""Lutzomyia"" sand flies also serve as vectors for the bacterial Carrions disease and a number of arboviruses. Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera (from the - ""cheir"", ""hand"" and - ""pteron"", ""wing"") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels, gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, as birds do, but instead flap their spread-out digits, which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The Phlebotominae are a subfamily of the family Psychodidae. In several countries, their common name is sand fly; but that name is also applied to other flies known as sandflies. The Phlebotominae include many genera of blood-feeding (hematophagous) flies, including the primary vectors of leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and pappataci fever. In the New World, leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus ""Lutzomyia"", which commonly live in caves, where their main hosts are bats. In the Old World, sand flies in the genus ""Phlebotomus"" spread leishmaniasis. The Old World consists of Africa, Europe, and Asia, regarded collectively as the part of the world known to Europeans before contact with the Americas. It is used in the context of, and contrast with, the New World (Americas). Leishmaniasis, also spelled leishmaniosis, is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus ""Leishmania"" and spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies. The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose, and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver.
Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of ""Leishmania"". Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation, and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under the microscope. Additionally, visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests.
Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of ""Leishmania"", and the type of infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.
About 12 million people are currently infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year. About 200 million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has obtained discounts on some medications to treat the disease. The disease may occur in a number of other animals, including dogs and rodents. Midges are a group of insects that include many kinds of small flies . They are found ( seasonally or otherwise ) on practically every land area outside permanently arid deserts and the frigid zones . The term `` midge '' does not define any particular taxonomic group , but includes species in several families of Nematoceran Diptera . Some midges , such as many Phlebotominae ( sand fly ) and Simuliidae ( black fly ) , are vectors of various diseases . Many others play useful roles as prey items for insectivores , such as various frogs and swallows . Others are important as detritivores , participating in various nutrient cycles . The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species , though within any particular family midges commonly have similar ecological roles . Examples of families that include species of midges include : Blephariceridae , net - winged midges Cecidomyiidae , gall midges Ceratopogonidae , biting midges ( also known as no - see - ums or punkies in North America , and sandflies in Australia ) Chaoboridae , phantom midges Chironomidae , non-biting midges ( also known as muffleheads in the Great Lakes region of North America ) Deuterophlebiidae , mountain midges Dixidae , meniscus midges Scatopsidae , dung midges Thaumaleidae , solitary midges Bartonellosis is an infectious disease produced by bacteria of the genus ""Bartonella"".
""Bartonella"" species cause diseases such as Carrións disease, trench fever, cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, peliosis hepatis, chronic bacteremia, endocarditis, chronic lymphadenopathy, and neurological disorders. Phlebotomus is a genus of ""sand flies"" in the Diptera family Psychodidae. In the past, they have sometimes been considered to belong in a separate family, Phlebotomidae, but this alternative classification has not gained wide acceptance. Pappataci fever (also known as Phlebotomus fever and, somewhat confusingly, sandfly fever and three-day fever) is a vector-borne febrile arboviral infection caused by three serotypes of Phlebovirus. It occurs in subtropical regions of the Eastern Hemisphere. The name, pappataci fever, comes from the Italian word for sandfly, it is the union of the word ""pappa"" (food) and taci (silent) which distinguish these insect from mosquitoes which produce a typical noise while flying."

","Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a ""backbone"" or ""spine""), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. An exoskeleton (from Greek , ""éx"" ""outer"" and , ""skeletos"" ""skeleton"") is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as ""shells"". Examples of animals with exoskeletons include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of certain sponges and the various groups of shelled molluscs, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons. Some animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton. In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of ""phylum"", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation ""phylum"". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. Chitin (CHON) is a long-chain polymer of an ""N""-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose, and is found in many places throughout the natural world. It is a characteristic component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulae of molluscs, and the beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses and on the scales and other soft tissues of fish and lissamphibians. The structure of chitin is comparable to the polysaccharide cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin. Chitin has proved versatile for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes. The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. An arthropod (from Greek ""arthro-"", joint + ""podos"", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. 
Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. Amphiesmenoptera is an insect superorder , established by S. G. Kiriakoff , but often credited to Willi Hennig in his revision of insect taxonomy for two sister orders : Lepidoptera ( butterflies and moths ) and Trichoptera ( caddisflies ) . Trichoptera and Lepidoptera share a number of derived characters ( synapomorphies ) which demonstrate their common descent : Females , rather than males , are heterogametic ( i.e. their sex chromosomes differ ) . Dense setae are present the wings ( modified into scales in Lepidoptera ) . There is a particular venation pattern on the forewings ( the double - looped anal veins ) . Larvae have mouth structures and glands to make and manipulate silk . Thus the two sister orders are grouped into the Amphiesmenoptera . The group probably evolved in the Jurassic , diverging from the extinct Necrotaulidae . Lepidoptera differ from the Trichoptera in several features , including wing venation , form of the scales on the wings , loss of the cerci , loss of an ocellus , and changes to the legs . Amphiesmenoptera are thought to be the sister group of Antliophora , a proposed superorder comprising Diptera ( flies ) , Siphonaptera ( fleas ) and Mecoptera ( scorpionflies ) . Together , Amphiesmenoptera and Antliophora compose the group Mecopterida . The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], ""cut into sections"") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. The thorax or chest (from the Greek  ""thorax"" ""breastplate, cuirass, corslet"" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain. Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists."

Two knots are considered equivalent if they can be transformed into each other through an ambient isotopy, a continuous deformation of the space that preserves orientation. The State University of New York at Buffalo, formerly known as the University of Buffalo, is a public research university with a strong focus on innovative research and a large endowment. It is home to William W. Menasco, a topologist known for his work in knot theory. The SUNY system, led by Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher, is one of the largest comprehensive systems of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the United States, with a total enrollment of 465,000 students and a $10.7 billion budget. The University at Buffalo, the largest campus in the SUNY system, has the greatest endowment and research funding. In topology, a homeomorphism is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function, preserving all topological properties of a given space. A circle, a simple closed shape in Euclidean geometry, is an example of a topological space. Topology is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Important topological properties include connectedness and compactness. ","A right fielder, abbreviated RF, is the outfielder in baseball or softball who plays defense in right field. Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher's mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9. A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fastpitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it (and baseball) were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will be reinstated for the 2020 Games. In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. In baseball, a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner. The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base, but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10. The Chicago White Sox is an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The White Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. The White Sox play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's South Side. They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the Chicago Cubs, who are a member of the National League (NL) Central division. The team is currently owned by Jerry Reinsdorf. The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the ""Senior Circuit""). At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a ""title"". Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. Luis Ernesto Aparicio Montiel (born April 29, 1934), nicknamed ""Little Louie"", was the first Venezuelan professional baseball player to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1984. He was one of the most dominant shortstops of Major League Baseball (MLB) in his era. He played for the Chicago White Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Boston Red Sox, from 1956 through 1973.  The Detroit Tigers are an American professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Tigers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in . They are the oldest continuous one-name, one-city franchise in the AL. The Tigers have won four World Series championships (1935, 1945, 1968, and 1984), 11 AL pennants (1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1968, 1984, 2006, and 2012), and four AL Central division championships (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). The Tigers also won division titles in 1972, 1984 and 1987 while members of the AL East. The team currently plays its home games at Comerica Park in Downtown Detroit. Tyrus Raymond ""Ty"" Cobb (December 18, 1886  July 17, 1961), nicknamed The Georgia Peach, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder. He was born in rural Narrows, Georgia. Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers, the last six as the team's player-manager, and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes (98.2%); no other player received a higher percentage of votes until 1992. In 1999, editors at the ""Sporting News"" ranked Ty Cobb 3rd on their list of ""Baseball's 100 Greatest Players"". The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in 13. Founded in as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since . The ""Red Sox"" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, around , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the ""Boston Red Stockings"", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves. George Washington Case ( November 11 , 1915 -- January 23 , 1989 ) was an American left and right fielder in Major League Baseball who played most of his career for the Washington Senators . Possibly the sport 's fastest player between the 1920s and 1950s , he is the only player to lead the major leagues in stolen bases five consecutive times ( from 1939 to 1943 ) , and his six overall league titles tied Ty Cobb 's American League record ; that mark was later broken by Luis Aparicio . His 349 career steals ranked ninth in AL history at the end of his career , and were the most by any player from 1930 to 1960 ; his 321 steals with the Senators were the third most in Washington history . Born in Trenton , New Jersey , Case attended the Peddie School in Hightstown and made his first appearance with the Senators in September 1937 , and in his 1938 rookie season batted .305 . In 1939 he batted .302 , led the Senators with 103 runs , and topped the league for the first time with 51 steals , also earning the first of four All - Star selections . In 1940 he posted career highs in runs ( 109 ) , hits ( 192 ) and runs batted in ( 56 ) while recording 35 steals . After having 33 stolen bases and leading the AL in assists in 1941 , he hit a career - high .320 in 1942 , again scoring over 100 runs with 44 steals . In 1943 he won his fifth straight title with 61 stolen bases , equalling the highest total in the major leagues between 1921 and 1961 ; he also led the AL with 102 runs , with a personal best of 36 doubles and a .294 average , as the Senators enjoyed their first winning season since 1936 , finishing second in the AL to the New York Yankees . 1944 saw him slip to a .250 average and only 63 runs , though he finished second to Snuffy Stirnweiss in the AL with 49 steals . 1945 saw him again finish second to Stirnweiss with 30 steals as he raised his average to .294 ; the Senators again finished second , only a game and a half behind the Detroit Tigers , and Case earned his last All - Star selection ( though the game was cancelled due to war restrictions ) and finished ninth in the MVP voting . In December 1945 , he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Jeff Heath ; in 1946 he won his last stolen base title with 28 , though he only batted .225 with just 46 runs . During that season , new Indians owner Bill Veeck staged one of his famous promotions , matching Case against Jesse Owens in a 100 - yard race which Owens won . In March 1947 Case was traded back to the Senators , and after hitting for a .150 average in 36 games he retired due to spinal problems which had plagued him throughout his career . Over his 11 - year career he batted .282 with 785 runs , 21 home runs and 377 RBI in 1226 games played . His 321 steals with the Senators placed him behind only Clyde Milan ( 495 ) and Sam Rice ( 346 ) in Washington history . In retirement , Case opened a sporting goods store in Trenton , and also coached at Rutgers from 1950 to 1960 , winning the school 's only College World Series berth in his first year . He later coached for the expansion Senators from 1961 -- 63 , and for the Minnesota Twins ( the relocated original Senators ) in 1968 ; he also managed in the Pacific Coast League for two seasons in the 1960s . In 1969 he became a minor league instructor for the Yankees , and later had the same position with the Seattle Mariners . He died of emphysema at age 73 in Trenton . The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland. The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901 with President Ban Johnson, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns. After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by Baltimore business interests led by Clarence Miles. The franchise officially moved to Baltimore for the 1954 season and adopted the historic ""Orioles"" name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland. The Orioles name had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including the franchise that would eventually become the New York Yankees. Nicknames for the team include the ""O's"" and the ""Birds""."

It originated in Europe and involved more than 70 million military personnel, resulting in over nine million combatant and seven million civilian deaths. The war was characterized by technological and industrial advancements, as well as trench warfare, which led to a high casualty rate.

The Sudetenland, a region in Czechoslovakia inhabited primarily by ethnic Germans, was annexed by Nazi Germany through the Munich Agreement in 1938. This agreement, signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, allowed for the annexation of the Sudetenland and is widely regarded as a failed act of appeasement toward Germany.

The Sudetenland was home to the football club NSTG Aussig, which played in the Gauliga Sudetenland during World War II. The region's strategic importance to Czechoslovakia was significant, as it housed border defenses, banks, and heavy industrial districts.

After the war, Czechoslovakia was formed as a sovereign state in Central Europe, comprising the historical Czech lands of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. Moravia, a historical country in the Czech Republic, was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown and later an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire. It was also a crown land of the Austrian Empire and briefly a crown land of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

The Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe, covering an area of and having a population of 10.5 million. The country includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia, with Prague as its capital and largest city.

","Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a ""literature of ideas."" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. M.E.Ch.A. (Spanish: Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán; ""Chicanx Student Movement of Aztlán"", the x being a gender neutral inflection) is an organization that seeks to promote Chicano unity and empowerment through political action. The acronym of the organization's name is the Chicano word ""mecha"", which is the Chicano pronunciation of the English word, ""match"" and therefore symbolic of a fire or spark; ""mecha"" in Spanish means fuse or wick. The motto of MEChA is 'La Union Hace La Fuerza In the United States, Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of UHF television stations featuring Saturday afternoon matinee showcases like ""Creature Double Feature"" and later in the 1990s when several ""Gamera"" films were featured on the TV show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog is an Irish / American fantasy - adventure television series set in a fantasy version of ancient Ireland , created by Saban Entertainment . It was loosely based on actual Irish mythology . The name derives from Tír na nÓg , one of the Otherworlds of Irish mythology . It was Saban 's first fantasy series to involve knights , dragons , and wizards . It aired on the Fox Kids block on Fox from September 1 , 1998 and ending on May 7 , 1999 . A second season entitled Mystic Knights : Battle Thunder was planned , but was later cancelled , and its budget was put towards Power Rangers Lost Galaxy . The resulting series was an attempt in doing an original non-Japanese special - effects series rather than adapting from actual Japanese tokusatsu . The Fenian Cycle or the, also referred to as the Ossianic Cycle after its narrator Oisín, is a body of prose and verse centring on the exploits of the mythical hero Fionn mac Cumhaill (Old, Middle, Modern Irish: Find, Finn, Fionn) and his warriors the Fianna. It is one of the four major cycles of Irish mythology along with the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle, and the Historical Cycle. Put in chronological order, the Fenian cycle is the third cycle, between the Ulster and Historical cycles. The cycle also contains stories about other famous Fianna members, including Diarmuid, Caílte, Oisín's son Oscar, and Fionn's enemy, Goll mac Morna. The mythology of pre-Christian Ireland did not entirely survive the conversion to Christianity. However, much of it was preserved in medieval Irish literature, though it was shorn of its religious meanings. This literature represents the most extensive and best preserved of all the branches of Celtic mythology. Although many of the manuscripts have not survived and much more material was probably never committed to writing, there is enough remaining to enable the identification of distinct, if overlapping, cycles: the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle, the Fenian Cycle and the Historical Cycle. There are also a number of extant mythological texts that do not fit into any of the cycles. Additionally, there are a large number of recorded folk tales that, while not strictly mythological, feature personages from one or more of these four cycles. ""Tokusatsu"" entertainment often deals with science fiction, fantasy or horror, but movies and television shows in other genres can sometimes count as ""tokusatsu"" as well. The most popular types of ""tokusatsu"" include ""kaiju"" monster movies like the ""Godzilla"" and ""Gamera"" film series; superhero TV serials such as the ""Kamen Rider"" and ""Metal Hero""; and mecha series like ""Giant Robo"". Some ""tokusatsu"" television programs combine several of these subgenres, for example the ""Ultraman"" and ""Super Sentai"" series. Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see ""literary"" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. The Mythological Cycle is a conventional division within Irish mythology,
concerning a set of tales about the godlike peoples said to have arrived in five migratory invasions into Ireland and principally recounting the doings of the Tuatha Dé Danann.
It is one of the four major cycles of early Irish literary tradition, the others being the Ulster Cycle, the Fenian Cycle and the Cycles of the Kings. The is the name given to the long-running Japanese superhero team franchise of TV series produced by Toei Co., Ltd., Toei Agency and Bandai, and aired by TV Asahi (""""Sentai"""" is the Japanese word for ""task force"" or ""fighting squadron""). The shows are of the tokusatsu genre, featuring live action characters and colorful special effects, and are aimed at children. The Super Sentai Series is one of the most prominent tokusatsu franchises in Japan, alongside the Ultra Series and the Kamen Rider Series, which it currently airs alongside in the ""Super Hero Time"" programming block on Sundays. Outside Japan, the Super Sentai Series is best known as the source material for the ""Power Rangers"" franchise. The Fox Broadcasting Company (often shortened to/commonly referred to as Fox) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary of 21st Century Fox. The network is headquartered at the 20th Century Fox studio lot on Pico Boulevard in the Century City section of Los Angeles, with additional major offices and production facilities at the Fox Television Center in nearby West Los Angeles and the Fox Broadcasting Center in Yorkville, Manhattan, New York. It is the third largest major television network in the world based on total revenues, assets, and international coverage. Power Rangers is an American entertainment and merchandising franchise built around a live action superhero television series. Produced first by Saban Entertainment, later by BVS Entertainment, and by SCG Power Rangers, the television series takes much of its footage from the Japanese tokusatsu ""Super Sentai"", produced by Toei Company. The first ""Power Rangers"" entry, ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", debuted on August 28, 1993, and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s, during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai.

It is depicted as a supernatural realm of everlasting youth, beauty, health, abundance and joy. Its inhabitants are the Tuatha Dé Danann, the gods of pre-Christian Ireland. In the ""echtrae"" (adventure) and ""immram"" (voyage) tales, various Irish mythical heroes visit Tír na nÓg after a voyage or an invitation from one of its residents. They reach it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, or by going under water or across the sea. Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres.

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (  Fainaru Fantaj Takutikusu Adobansu ) is a tactical role - playing game developed and published by Square ( now Square Enix ) for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance . A spin - off of the popular Final Fantasy series , the game shares several traits with 1997 's Final Fantasy Tactics , although it is not a direct sequel . The player assembles a clan of characters , and controls their actions over grid - like battlefields . Players are mostly free to decide the classes , abilities , and statistics of their characters . The game 's story centers on four children ; Marche , Mewt , Ritz , and Doned , who live in a small town named St. Ivalice . The children are transported to a realm of the same name as their town , `` Ivalice '' , after discovering an ancient magical book . The story then focuses on the exploits of Marche as he attempts to return to the real world while facing opposition from those around him . Tactics Advance is one of the initial products from the cooperation of Square and Nintendo made for the Game Boy Advance console ; it was developed by the team brought over from the game company Quest Corporation . Following its release , Tactics Advance - themed merchandise was introduced . The game was positively received . It has a sequel , Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift for the Nintendo DS.

The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region, and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice is also used to refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries."

Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design. Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. HornbostelSachs or SachsHornbostel is a system of musical instrument classification devised by Erich Moritz von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs, and first published in the ""Zeitschrift für Ethnologie"" in 1914. An English translation was published in the ""Galpin Society Journal"" in 1961. It is the most widely used system for classifying musical instruments by ethnomusicologists and organologists (people who study musical instruments). The system was updated in 2011 as part of the work of the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO) Project. Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means ""of the skin"" (from Latin ""cutis"", skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless.
The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as ""crows feet"" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the back is 14 mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen. Early music is music, especially Western art music, composed prior to the Classical era. The term generally comprises Medieval music (5001400) and Renaissance music (14001600), but can also include Baroque music (16001760), and, according to some authorities such as Kennedy (who excludes Baroque), Ancient music (before 500 AD). According to the UK's National Centre for Early Music, the term ""early music"" refers to both a repertory (European music written between 1250 and 1750 embracing Medieval, Renaissance and the Baroque)  and a historically informed approach to the performance of that music. However, today this term has come to include ""any music for which a historically appropriate style of performance must be reconstructed on the basis of surviving scores, treatises, instruments and other contemporary evidence."" Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the ""color"" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (""mousike""; ""art of the Muses""). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as ""the harmony of the spheres"" and ""it is music to my ears"" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no noise, only sound."" Renaissance music is vocal and instrumental music written and performed in Europe during the Renaissance era. Consensus among music historians  with notable dissent  has been to start the era around 1400, with the end of the medieval era, and to close it around 1600, with the beginning of the Baroque period, therefore commencing the musical Renaissance about a hundred years after the beginning of the Renaissance as it is understood in other disciplines. As in the other arts, the music of the period was significantly influenced by the developments which define the Early Modern period: the rise of humanistic thought; the recovery of the literary and artistic heritage of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome; increased innovation and discovery; the growth of commercial enterprises; the rise of a bourgeois class; and the Protestant Reformation. From this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the polyphonic style (this means music with multiple, independent melody lines performed simultaneously) of the Franco-Flemish school, whose greatest master was Josquin des Prez. James Tyler ( August 3 , 1940 Hartford , Connecticut , USA -- November 23 , 2010 Los Angeles , California , USA ) was an American lutenist , banjoist , guitarist , composer , musicologist and author , who featured on over sixty early music recordings . He was born in Hartford , Connecticut , and initially studied the banjo ( classic 5 - string and tenor ) and Mandolin with Walter K. Bauer , then the lute with Joseph Iadone - he also played the cello . As a lutenist , he performed and recorded with New York Pro Musica , and also toured and recorded as a banjoist with ' Max Morath and the Original Rag Quartet ' . In 1969 , his interest in early music took him to London where he married Joyce Geller . During the 1970s and 1980s , he performed and recorded in London with Anthony Rooley , Musica Reservata , the Consort of Musicke , the Julian Bream Consort and the Early Music Consort of London under David Munrow . He then founded his own ensemble , the ' London Early Music Group ' in 1977 , which lasted until 1990 . He composed music for BBC television productions of Shakespeare plays , and also made an appearance as a lutenist in the 1971 film , Mary Queen of Scots . In 1986 , he became professor of music and director of the master 's and doctoral degree programs in early music performance at the University of Southern California ( USC ) , a post he held until retiring in 2006 . Apart from the instruments mentioned , he was considered expert on the Renaissance and Baroque guitars . As a musicologist he travelled around Europe and the US researching and transcribing hundreds of early music works . He authored several books on early plucked instruments and their music ( see bibliography ) , and wrote articles for various publications . James Tyler died on November 23 , 2010 , after a short illness , aged 70 ."

With a motto of ""Welcome Home,"" the event featured 10,625 athletes from 201 countries competing in 301 medal events across 28 sports. This edition of the Games was significant as it was the first time all countries with a National Olympic Committee participated.

In the realm of beach volleyball, a sport introduced to the Olympics in 1996, Juan Miguel Rossell Milanes from Cuba emerged as a notable figure. He won the gold medal in the men's beach team competition at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, partnering Francisco Alvarez. Rossell Milanes also represented Cuba at the 1996 and 2004 Summer Olympics.

The Pan American Games, a major sporting event in the Americas, also featured beach volleyball as a competitive discipline. The 14th Pan American Games took place in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in 2003. The successful bid for the games was made in the mid-1990s, when the Dominican Republic experienced one of the highest growth rates in Latin America.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted in 1986 to separate the Summer and Winter Games, which had been held in the same year since 1924, and place them in alternating even-numbered years, beginning in 1994. The 1996 Summer Games were the first to be staged in a different year from the Winter Games. Atlanta, Georgia, United States, hosted the 1996 Summer Games, becoming the fifth American city to host the Olympic Games and the third to hold a Summer Olympic Games. ","Imre Lakatos (; November 9, 1922  February 2, 1974) was a Hungarian philosopher of mathematics and science, known for his thesis of the fallibility of mathematics and its 'methodology of proofs and refutations' in its pre-axiomatic stages of development, and also for introducing the concept of the 'research programme' in his methodology of scientific research programmes. Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study. It comprises the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge. Typically, it encompasses concepts such as paradigm, theoretical model, phases and quantitative or qualitative techniques. Philosophy (from Greek , ""philosophia"", literally ""love of wisdom"") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? Broadly speaking, Fallibilism (from Medieval Latin: ""fallibilis"", ""liable to err"") is the philosophical claim that no belief can have justification which guarantees the truth of the belief. However, not all fallibilists believe that fallibilism extends to all domains of knowledge. A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term ""philosopher"" comes from the Ancient Greek (""philosophos"") meaning ""lover of wisdom"". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein (26 April 1889  29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. From 1929 to 1947, Wittgenstein taught at the University of Cambridge. During his lifetime he published just one slim book, the 75-page ""Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"" (1921), one article, one book review and a children's dictionary. His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. ""Philosophical Investigations"" appeared as a book in 1953, and has since come to be recognised as one of the most important works of philosophy in the twentieth century. His teacher Bertrand Russell described Wittgenstein as ""the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating."" Paul Ernest is a contributor to the social constructivist ( see social constructivism ) philosophy of mathematics . Ernest 's philosophical sources are the later works of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the fallibilism of Imre Lakatos . This social constructivist philosophy claims that both the theorems and truths of mathematics , and the objects of mathematics , are cultural products created by humans . Furthermore the theorems and truths of mathematics always remain corrigible , revisible , and indeed fallible -- in principle at least . This does not mean that mathematical knowledge is flawed or at risk . However , the claim is that the belief that mathematical knowledge is infallible can not be demonstrated , it is an article of faith , even if the warrants for mathematical knowledge are the strongest warrants available to humankind for any knowledge claims . Ernest illustrates this position in his discussion of the issue of whether mathematics is discovered or invented . His fullest exposition of the social constructivist position is given in the 1998 reference , although an earlier version is given in the 1991 reference . Ernest 's version of social constructivism is controversial and has led to strong criticism . The principal criticism is that mathematical theorems are truths and truths by their nature are infallible . In his account of social constructivism Ernest links the worlds of research mathematics and that of school and college mathematics . This link is achieved though the role of experts who as teachers communicate mathematical knowledge to learners and warrant their personal knowledge by means of testing and assessment . As researchers experts both create new mathematical knowledge and warrant the productions of others . Through this linkage the personal knowledge of the experts is developed and itself warranted . Both explicit mathematical knowledge representations and personal mathematical knowledge circulate between the worlds of education and research , which are not themselves wholly disjoint . The personal knowledge cycle is mutually refreshing for both education and research . A criticism of this account is that if mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and accepted it might be accepted purely on the basis of group agreement . However Ernest argues that mathematical knowledge communication , creation and warranting take place in historical communities that respect traditions of mathematical practice with embedded and partly tacit criteria for acceptability . Such rules include accepted forms of presentation , reasoning , and consistency . Although these are historically contingent they are never arbitrary and in general conserve mathematical concepts , theories and rules of acceptance . Furthermore , the democratic , rational and critical elements of mathematical thinking and mathematical communities mean that errors are eliminated . A criticism of this position is that it conflates the social institution of mathematics with objective mathematical knowledge . Paul Ernest was born in New York City , New York in to parents John Ernest and Elna Ernest ( née Adlerbert ) . However he has lived and worked in the UK since childhood , apart from two years of teaching at the University of the West Indies , Jamaica ( 1982 -- 84 ) . He is currently emeritus professor of the philosophy of mathematics education at Exeter University , UK . Originally a student of mathematics and philosophy up to PhD level he became interested in educational issues through teaching school mathematics in London during the 1970s . His main research interests concern fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics and how it relates to teaching , learning and society . He has developed a semiotic theory of mathematics and education . He is best known for his work on philosophical aspects of mathematics education and his contributions to developing a social constructivist philosophy of mathematics . He is currently working on the ethics of mathematics . Philosophy of language seeks to understand the relationship between language and reality. Major topics in philosophy of language are the nature of meaning, intentionality, reference, the constitution of sentences, learning, and thought. Philosophical Investigations is a work by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, first published, posthumously, in 1953, in which Wittgenstein discusses numerous problems and puzzles in the fields of semantics, logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind. He puts forth the view that conceptual confusions surrounding language use are at the root of most philosophical problems, contradicting or discarding much of what he argued in his earlier work, the ""Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"" (1921). The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (TLP) (Latin for ""Logico-Philosophical Treatise"") is the only book-length philosophical work published by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in his lifetime. The project had a broad aimto identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of scienceand is recognized as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century. G. E. Moore originally suggested the work's Latin title as homage to the ""Tractatus Theologico-Politicus"" by Baruch Spinoza. The philosophy of mathematics is the branch of philosophy that studies the philosophical assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics. The aim of the philosophy of mathematics is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts. Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, (18 May 1872  2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist and Nobel laureate. At various points in his life he considered himself a liberal, a socialist, and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had ""never been any of these things, in any profound sense"". He was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom. Medieval Latin was the form of Latin used in the Middle Ages, primarily: as a medium of scholarly exchange; as the liturgical language of Chalcedonian Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church; and as a language of science, literature, law, and administration. Despite the clerical origin of many of its authors, medieval Latin should not be confused with Ecclesiastical Latin. There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where Late Latin ends and medieval Latin begins. Some scholarly surveys begin with the rise of early Ecclesiastical Latin in the middle of the 4th century, others around 500, and still others with the replacement of written Late Latin by written Romance languages starting around the year 900."

","A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. Chicago is a 1927 comedy - drama silent film produced by Cecil B. DeMille and directed by Frank Urson . Frank John Urson (March 21, 1887  August 17, 1928) was an American silent film director and cinematographer from Chicago, Illinois. Originally a photographer, he moved on to cinematography and film directing for the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York. He is also credited with acting in one film ""Her Gallant Knights"" which starred William Garwood in 1913. Urson directed ""Changing Husbands"". He is perhaps best known for his 1927 ""Chicago"", produced by Cecil B. DeMille. The Thanhouser Company (later the Thanhouser Film Corporation) was one of the first motion picture studios, founded in 1909 by Edwin Thanhouser, his wife Gertrude and his brother-in-law Lloyd Lonergan. It operated in New York City until 1918, producing over a thousand films. A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano.

A suburb is a residential area or a mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city. In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, ""suburb"" has become largely synonymous with what is called a ""neighborhood"" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county."

The National Capital Region (NCR) is composed of Manila, the capital city of the country, Quezon City, the country's most populous city, and the cities of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, Pasig, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela, including the only remaining municipality of Pateros. The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted ""Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union"", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean.

","Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory. Jurisdiction (from the Latin ""ius, "" meaning ""law"" and """" meaning ""to speak"") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law. Shenzhen is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province. Beijing (formerly romanised as Peking) is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the world's third most populous city proper. It is also one of the world's most populous capital cities. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighbouring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China. A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe. The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015).

Henry Fok Stadium ( Simplified Chinese :  ) is a multi-purpose stadium in Panyu , China . It is currently used mostly for football matches and was one of the six stadiums used for the 1991 FIFA Women 's World Cup . The stadium has a capacity of 15,000 people . It is named after Henry Fok Ying Tung , a businessman who left a large amount of money for this constructions . Multi-purpose stadiums are a type of stadium designed to be easily used by multiple types of events. While any stadium could potentially host more than one type of sport or event, this concept usually refers to a specific design philosophy that stresses multifunctionality over specificity. It is used most commonly in Canada and the United States, where the two most popular outdoor team sports  football and baseball  require radically different facilities. Football uses a rectangular field (Canadian football fields are larger than American ones), while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield. This requires a particular design to accommodate both, usually an oval. While building stadiums in this way means that sports teams and governments can share costs, it also imposes some challenges. In international relations, a regional power is a state that has power within a geographic region. States which wield unrivalled power and influence within a region of the world possess regional hegemony. A stadium (plural stadiums or stadia) is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event. Chongqing, formerly transliterated as Chungking, is a major city in Southwest China and one of the Five national central cities in China.

The applications of percolation theory to materials science and other domains are discussed in the article percolation. Harry Kesten ( 19 November 1931 , Germany ) is an American mathematician best known for his work in probability , most notably on random walks and percolation theory . A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br>
It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word ""republic"" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word ""republic"" in their names. Statistical physics is a branch of physics that uses methods of probability theory and statistics, and particularly the mathematical tools for dealing with large populations and approximations, in solving physical problems. It can describe a wide variety of fields with an inherently stochastic nature. Its applications include many problems in the fields of physics, biology, chemistry, neurology, and even some social sciences, such as sociology. Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion. Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: ""Hamborg"" ), officially ""Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg"" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. The interdisciplinarity field of materials science, also commonly termed materials science and engineering, involves the discovery and design of new materials, with an emphasis on solids. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study. 
Many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limits of the materials that are available. Thus, breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly. Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: ""Düsseldörp"" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. In mathematics, random graph is the general term to refer to probability distributions over graphs. Random graphs may be described simply by a probability distribution, or by a random process which generates them. The theory of random graphs lies at the intersection between graph theory and probability theory. From a mathematical perspective, random graphs are used to answer questions about the properties of ""typical"" graphs. Its practical applications are found in all areas in which complex networks need to be modeled  a large number of random graph models are thus known, mirroring the diverse types of complex networks encountered in different areas. In a mathematical context, ""random graph"" refers almost exclusively to the ErdsRényi random graph model. In other contexts, any graph model may be referred to as a ""random graph"". Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. Stuttgart ( Swabian: ""Schduagert""), often nicknamed the """"Schwabenmetropole"""" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the ""Stuttgarter Kessel"" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word """"Stuogarten"","" or ""stud farm""  a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. In physics, chemistry and materials science, percolation (from Latin ""perclre"", ""to filter"" or ""trickle through"") refers to the movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials. Mathematics (from Greek  ""máthma"", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries."

Born Juliet Marion Hulme on October 28, 1938, Perry was convicted of murder at the age of fifteen. After serving her five-year sentence, she changed her name and began writing.

Thomas Pitt, the protagonist of Perry's series, is a police inspector from a working-class background in Victorian London. His father was a gamekeeper on a landed estate, and Pitt was educated alongside the son of the house. Pitt's father was wrongly accused of poaching game and transported to Australia, prompting Pitt to enter the police force.

At the beginning of the series, Pitt is a police inspector, but he is later promoted to superintendent. However, he is removed from his job after investigating the ""wrong people,"" i.e., those with sufficient influence and power. He joins the Special Branch, where he becomes an inspector and later a commander as Head of Special Branch.

Pitt's wife, Charlotte Ellison, is from an upper-class family. Her sister, Emily, is married to a viscount and a rising politician. Charlotte frequently uses Emily's connections to assist Pitt in his investigations. She relies on her maid, Gracie, to take care of her children, Jemima and Daniel, when Pitt is investigating a mystery.

Vespasia Cumming-Gould, the elderly aunt of Emily's first husband, becomes a friend to both Emily and Charlotte, easing their way into society. The first novel in the series, The Cater Street Hangman, was adapted for TV in 1998.

","A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words ""Fennia"" (Finland) and ""Scandia"" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe. The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea. Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: ""Norgga""), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf. Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east.

At Braemar, the road then switches east down the strath of the River Dee before crossing the A90 and terminating in Aberdeen.  In topography, prominence characterizes the height of a mountain or hill's summit by the vertical distance between it and the lowest contour line encircling it but containing no higher summit within it. It is a measure of the independence of a summit. A peak's ""key col"" is a unique point on this contour line and the parent peak is some higher mountain, selected according to various objective criteria.  The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. Sir Hugh Thomas Munro, 4th Baronet (18561919) was a Scottish mountaineer who is best known for his list of mountains in Scotland over 3,000 feet (914.4 m), known as the Munros. The Spittal of Glenshee lies at the head of Glenshee in the highlands of eastern Perth and Kinross, Scotland where the confluence of many small streams flowing south out of the Grampians form the Shee Water. For centuries, there has been a hostel or inn at the site and, in modern times, the small village has become a centre for travel, tourism and winter sports in the region, sited at a bend on the A93 trunk road which leads from Blairgowrie north past the Spittal to the Glenshee Ski Centre and on to Braemar. A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area  a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity."

It can be played in both upright and horizontal positions, allowing for tapping, picking, slapping, or strumming. Don Schiff, a versatile musician, is one of the earliest and most prominent Chapman Stick players. He has used the instrument in various recording sessions and live performances, developing new techniques such as ""tapping while plucking"" and ""slide technique"" using a carabiner. Schiff also played the NS/Stick, a collaboration between Chapman and Steinberger, which incorporated design ideas from both the Chapman Stick and Steinberger's instruments. Schiff's contributions to the Chapman Stick and NS/Stick have helped popularize these innovative instruments in the music industry. ","India, officially the Republic of India (""Bhrat Gaarjya""), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. Old World warblers are a large group of birds formerly grouped together in the bird family Sylviidae. The family held over 400 species in over 70 genera, and were the source of much taxonomic confusion. Two families were split out initially, the cisticolas into Cisticolidae and the kinglets into Regulidae. In the past ten years they have been the subject of much research and many species are now placed into other families, including the Acrocephalidae, Cettiidae, Phylloscopidae, and Megaluridae. In addition some species have been moved into existing families or have not yet had their placement fully resolved. A smaller family of warblers, together with some babblers formerly placed in the family Timaliidae and the parrotbills, are retained in a much smaller family Sylviidae. A kinglet, or crest, is a small bird in a group that is sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but is frequently placed in its own family, Regulidae, because of resemblance to titmice. ""Regulidae"" is derived from the Latin word ""regulus"" for ""petty king"" or prince, and refers to the coloured crowns of adult birds. This family has representatives in North America and Eurasia. There are seven species in this family; one, the Madeira firecrest, ""Regulus madeirensis"", was only recently split from common firecrest as a separate species. One species, the ruby-crowned kinglet, differs sufficiently in its voice and plumage to occasionally be afforded its own genus, ""Corthylio"".
Description.
Kinglets are among the smallest of all passerines, ranging in size from and weighing ; the sexes are the same size. They have medium-length wings and tails, and small needle-like bills. The plumage is overall grey-green, offset by pale wingbars, and the tail tip is incised. Five species have a single stiff feather covering the nostrils, but in the ruby-crowned kinglet, this is replaced by several short, stiff bristles. Most kinglets have distinctive head markings, and the males possess a colourful crown patch. In the females, the crown is duller and yellower. The long feathers forming the central crown stripe can be erected; they are inconspicuous most of the time, but are used in courtship and territorial displays when the raised crest is very striking. Cettiidae is a newly validated family of small insectivorous songbirds (""warblers""), formerly placed in the Old World warbler ""wastebin"" assemblage. It contains the typical bush warblers (""Cettia"") and their relatives. As a common name, cettiid warblers is usually used. A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. Cettia is a genus of small insectivorous songbirds (""warblers"") which make up the core of the newly recognized family Cettiidae. They were formerly placed in the Sylviidae, which at that time was a wastebin taxon for the warbler-like Sylvioidea. The range of this genus extends from Europe to southeast Asia. Sylviidae is a family of passerine birds that was part of an assemblage known as the Old World warblers. The family was a wastebin taxon with over 400 species of bird in over 70 genera. Advances in classification, particularly helped with molecular data, have led to the splitting out of several new families from within this group. Today the smaller family Sylviidae includes the typical warblers in the genus ""Sylvia"", the parrotbills of Asia (formerly a separate family Paradoxornithidae), a number of babblers formerly placed within the family Timaliidae (which is being split) and the wrentit, a North American bird that has been a longstanding taxonomic mystery. The brown - flanked bush warbler ( Horornis fortipes ) , also known as the brownish - flanked bush warbler , is a species of bush - warbler belonging to the Cettiidae family . It was formerly included in the `` Old World warbler '' assemblage . It is found in South Asia . Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. The Cisticolidae family of small passerine birds is a group of about 110 warblers found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. They are often included within the Old World warbler family Sylviidae. East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. Phylloscopidae is a newly described family of small insectivorous birds formerly placed in the Old World warbler family. Phylloscopidae contains two genera, ""Phylloscopus"" and ""Seicercus"", respectively containing around 55 and 11 species. The leaf warblers are a branch of ""Old World warblers,"" one of 10 or more branches that sprouted as Families with the break-up of the Sylviidae. Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.  In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from east. South Asia or Southern Asia is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. South is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. It is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. South is the polar opposite of north and is perpendicular to east and west. The Acrocephalidae (the reed warblers, marsh- and tree-warblers, or acrocephalid warblers) are a family of oscine passerine birds, in the superfamily Sylvioidea. In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin ""oscen"", ""a songbird"". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song."

In his later years, Rogers lent his name to the franchise chain of Roy Rogers Restaurants. Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the ""discovery stage"", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter. Andrew Vabre ""Andy"" Devine (October 7, 1905  February 18, 1977) was an American character actor and comic cowboy sidekick known for his distinctive whiny voice.

A children's hospital is a hospital which offers its services exclusively to children and adolescents. Most children's hospitals can serve children from birth up to the age of 18, or in some instances, children's hospitals' doctors may treat children until they finish high school. The number of children's hospitals proliferated in the 20th century, as pediatric medical and surgical specialties separated from internal medicine and adult surgical specialties. The Bloomsbury Groupor Bloomsbury Setwas an influential group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, the best known members of which included Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Lytton Strachey. This loose collective of friends and relatives lived, worked or studied together near Bloomsbury, London, during the first half of the 20th century. According to Ian Ousby, ""although its members denied being a group in any formal sense, they were united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts"". Their works and outlook deeply influenced literature, aesthetics, criticism, and economics as well as modern attitudes towards feminism, pacifism, and sexuality. Bloomsbury Square is a garden square in Holborn, Camden, London, built by James Burton. Internal medicine or general medicine (in Commonwealth nations) is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. Physicians specializing in internal medicine are called internists, or physicians (without a modifier) in Commonwealth nations. Internists are skilled in the management of patients who have undifferentiated or multi-system disease processes. Internists care for hospitalized and ambulatory patients and may play a major role in teaching and research. Earl of Southampton was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of England. The first creation came in 1537 in favour of the courtier William FitzWilliam. He was childless and the title became extinct on his death in 1542. The second creation came in 1547 in favour of the politician Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Baron Wriothesley, Lord Chancellor between 1544 and 1547. He had already been created Baron Wriothesley (pronounced ""rose ley"" /rozli/) in 1544, also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his third but only surviving son, the second Earl. On his death the titles passed to his second but only surviving son, the third Earl. He is best remembered as a patron of William Shakespeare. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the fourth Earl. He was a prominent statesman and served as Lord High Treasurer under Charles II between 1660 and 1667. In 1653 he had succeeded his father-in-law Francis Leigh, 1st Earl of Chichester as second Earl of Chichester according to a special remainder in the letters patent. However, Lord Southampton had no sons and the titles became extinct on his death in 1667. The third creation came in 1670 for Barbara Palmer, mistress of Charles II. She was made Baroness Nonsuch and Duchess of Cleveland at the same time. See the latter title for more information on this creation. Bloomsbury is an area in the West End, central London, forming part of the London Borough of Camden and located between Euston Road and Holborn. It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton. A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals."

The Autumn Harvest Uprising ( simplified Chinese :  ; traditional Chinese :  ; pinyin : Qushu Qyì ) was an insurrection that took place in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces , China , on September 7 , 1927 , led by Mao Zedong , who established a short - lived Hunan Soviet . Mao led a small army of peasants against the Kuomintang and the landlords of Hunan . The uprising was defeated by Kuomintang forces and Mao was forced to retreat to the Jinggang Mountains on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi provinces , where emerged an army of miners . This was the first armed uprising by the Communists , and it marked a significant change in their strategy . Mao and Red Army founder Zhu De went on to develop a rural - based strategy that centred on guerrilla tactics , paving the way to the Long March of 1934 ( the first Long March in 1918 not accountable ) . In their biography of Mao , Mao : the unknown story , Jung Chang and Jon Halliday dispute this version of events . Chang and Halliday claim that the ' uprising ' was in fact sabotaged by Mao to allow him to snare a force of Nationalist mutineers from Nanchang who were crossing over to the CCP , prevent them from defecting to any other CCP leader , and enhance his own personal power within the CCP . They claim that Mao 's three day delay in seeing the other leaders of the Hunan uprising , scheduled for 15 August but delayed by Mao until 18 August , was to allow Mao to check that the mutineers would still be passing close by and that if Mao had not had the opportunity of adding this force to his own forces within the CCP he would not have gone to south Hunan . Chang and Halliday also claim that Mao lobbied to ' narrow down ' the uprising and talked the other leaders ( including Russian diplomats at the Soviet consulate in Changsha who , Chang and Halliday claim , had been controlling much of the CCP activity ) into striking only at Changsha . This , they say , was in order to allow Mao to also gain control of a force of 1,700 peasant rebels and defectors from the Nationalist army who were near Changsha . Chang and Halliday point out that once Mao had gained control of these men , he then moved to a position 100 km east of Changsha at Wenjiashi and was there on 11 September , the uprising 's launch date , far from his troops , and that on 14 September , before the troops had reached Changsha or met heavy resistance , Mao ordered them to abandon the assault on Changsha and converge on his position . Chang and Halliday report a view sent to Moscow by the secretary of the Soviet Consulate in Changsha that the retreat was ' the most despicable treachery and cowardice . ' Chang and Halliday allege that Mao later fabricated the version of events ( which is still that taught by the CCP ) in order to hide the fact that far from leading a peasant uprising , he hijacked it for his own personal ends , sabotaged the organisation , and ran away with the new troops before the attack on Changsha had begun .

243,In which language was the original work of 'Topper' written?,english,"['english', 'greek', 'instrumental', 'latin', 'silent film', 'swedish']"," The Meech Lake Accord, negotiated in 1987 by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 10 provincial premiers, aimed to persuade Quebec to endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments by providing some decentralization of the Canadian federation. The Accord was ultimately rejected, leading to the formation of the Bloc Québécois, a federal political party devoted to Quebec nationalism and the promotion of Quebec sovereignty. Lucien Bouchard, the founder of the Bloc Québécois, served as the 27th Premier of Quebec from 1996 to 2001 and was a central figure in the 1995 Quebec referendum.

The Accord's rejection highlighted the tensions between Quebec and the rest of Canada, with Quebec nationalism asserting that the Québécois people are an independent nation. The Department of Canadian Heritage, responsible for policies and programs regarding the arts, culture, media, communications networks, official languages, status of women, sports, and multiculturalism, played a role in promoting Canadian identity and unity.

The Bloc Québécois, founded by Lucien Bouchard, has been a significant force in Canadian politics, advocating for Quebec's interests and sovereignty. The party has had representation in the House of Commons since its formation in 1993.

In summary, the Meech Lake Accord and the Bloc Québécois represent the ongoing tensions between Quebec and the rest of Canada. The Accord's rejection and the formation of the Bloc Québécois highlight the importance of Quebec nationalism and the need for a balance between decentralization and unity in the Canadian federation. ","Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root ""literatura""/""litteratura"" (derived itself from ""littera"": ""letter"" or ""handwriting"") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). Constance Campbell Bennett (October 22, 1904  July 24, 1965) was an American stage, film, radio and television actress what was a major Hollywood star during the 1920s and 1930s. For a time during the early 1930s, she was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, and one of the most popular. Bennett frequently played society women, focusing on melodramas in the early 1930s and then taking more comedic roles in the late 1930s and 1940s. She is best known today for her leading roles in ""Topper"" (1937), in which she co-starred with Cary Grant; its sequel ""Topper Takes a Trip"" (1938); and ""What Price Hollywood?"" (1932), its subsequent remakes for the 1937 film ""A Star is Born"". Bennett also had a prominent supporting role in Greta Garbo's last film, ""Two-Faced Woman"" (1941). A document is a written, drawn, presented or recorded representation of thoughts. Originating from the Latin ""Documentum"" meaning lesson - the verb doce means to teach, and is pronounced similarly, in the past it was usually used as a term for a written proof used as evidence. In the computer age, a document is usually used to describe a primarily textual file, along with its structure and design, such as fonts, colors and additional images. Mary William Ethelbert Appleton ""Billie"" Burke (August 7, 1884  May 14, 1970) was an American actress, famous on Broadway and in early silent film, best known to modern audiences as Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the movie musical ""The Wizard of Oz"". She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1938 for her performance as Emily Kilbourne in ""Merrily We Live"" and is also remembered for her appearances in the ""Topper"" series. Billie Burke was the wife of Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., of Ziegfeld Follies fame, from 1914 until his death in 1932. Her voice was unique in intonation, which she accentuated in her later character roles as dim-witted, spoiled society types. Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the ""color"" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (""mousike""; ""art of the Muses""). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as ""the harmony of the spheres"" and ""it is music to my ears"" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no noise, only sound."" Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word ""theatre"" as derived from the Ancient Greek  (théatron, ""a place for viewing""), itself from  (theáomai, ""to see"", ""to watch"", ""to observe""). Alan Mowbray MM (born Alfred Ernest Allen; 18 August 1896  25 March 1969) was an English stage and film actor who found success in Hollywood. A sequel is a narrative, documental, or other work of literature, film, theatre, television, music, or video game that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work.

The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. Arable land (from Latin ""arabilis"", ""able to be plowed"") is, according to one definition, land ""capable"" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries."

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.

Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just ""binomial""), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens"". The ""formal"" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work ""Species Plantarum"" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book ""Pinax theatri botanici"" (English, ""Illustrated exposition of plants"") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.

Until recently, they were all classified in the single genus ""Hippolais"". Old World warblers are a large group of birds formerly grouped together in the bird family Sylviidae. The family held over 400 species in over 70 genera, and were the source of much taxonomic confusion. Two families were split out initially, the cisticolas into Cisticolidae and the kinglets into Regulidae. In the past ten years they have been the subject of much research and many species are now placed into other families, including the Acrocephalidae, Cettiidae, Phylloscopidae, and Megaluridae. In addition some species have been moved into existing families or have not yet had their placement fully resolved. A smaller family of warblers, together with some babblers formerly placed in the family Timaliidae and the parrotbills, are retained in a much smaller family Sylviidae. There are a number of Passeriformes (perching birds) called warblers. They are not necessarily closely related to one another, but share some characteristics, such as being fairly small, vocal, and insectivorous.

It is a small passerine bird , found in dry open country , including cultivation , with bushes or some trees . 2 - 3 eggs are laid in a nest in low in undergrowth or a bush . Like most warblers , Eastern Olivaceous is insectivorous . It is a medium - sized warbler , more like a very pale reed warbler than its relative the melodious warbler . The adult has a plain pale brown back and whitish underparts . The bill is strong and pointed and the legs grey . The sexes are identical , as with most warblers , but young birds are more buff on the belly . It has a characteristic downward tail flick . Eastern olivaceous warbler breeds in south east Europe and the Middle East . It is migratory , wintering in sub-Saharan Africa or Arabia . It is a rare vagrant to northern Europe . Western olivaceous warbler differs from this species in being larger and having a browner tinge to the upperparts ; it also has a larger bill . Eastern olivaceous warbler sometimes has a greenish tinge to its upperparts , and can be very difficult to separate from Sykes 's warbler , Iduna rama . The song is a fast nasal babbling ."

Urban blues evolved from classic blues following the Great Migration, or the Great Northern Drive, which was both forced and voluntary at times, of African-Americans from the southern United States to the industrial cities of the north, such as Chicago. Muddy Waters directly joined that migration, like many others, such as in Florida, avoiding the more harshly southern Jim Crow laws. Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records stated that, ""Chicago blues is the music of the industrial city, and has an industrial sense about it."" Additionally, recognizing the shift in blues, Chicago Blues singer and guitarist, Kevin Moore expressed the blues transition stating, ""You have to put some new life into it, new blood, new perspectives. You can't keep talking about mules, workin' on the levee.""

When miniature golf retains many of these characteristics but without the use of any props or obstacles, it is purely a mini version of its parent game.

Party games are games that are played at social gatherings to facilitate interaction and provide entertainment and recreation. Categories include (explicit) icebreaker, parlour (indoor), picnic (outdoor), and large group games. Other types include pairing off (partnered) games, and parlour races. Different games will generate different atmospheres so the party game may merely be intended as an icebreakers, or the sole purpose for or structure of the party. As such, party games aim to include players of various skill levels and player-elimination is rare. Party games are intended to be played socially, and are designed to be easy for new players to learn. A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or ""board"", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill."

A correctional facility, detention center, gaol (Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, UK), jail (US, Canada), penitentiary, prison, or remand centre is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as a form of punishment after being convicted of crimes. Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until they are brought to trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. Besides their use for punishing civil crimes, jails and prisons are frequently used by authoritarian regimes. Heroin, also known as diamorphine among other names, is an opiate typically used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Medically it is occasionally used to relieve pain and as a form of opioid replacement therapy alongside counseling. Heroin is typically injected, usually into a vein; however, it can also be smoked, snorted or inhaled. Onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours.
Common side effects include respiratory depression (decreased breathing) and about a quarter of those who use heroin become physically dependent. Other side effects can include abscesses, infected heart valves, blood borne infections, constipation, and pneumonia. After a history of long-term use, withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of last use. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect as a similar dose of morphine. It typically comes as a white or brown powder.
Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. Medications used may include methadone or naltrexone. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. An estimated 17 million people as of 2015 use opiates such as heroin, which together with opioids resulted in 122,000 deaths. The total number of opiate users has increased from 1998 to 2007 after which it has remained more or less stable. In the United States about 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point in time. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid.
Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell heroin without a license. In 2015 Afghanistan produced about 66% of the world's opium. Often heroin, which is illegally sold, is mixed with other substances such as sugar or strychnine. Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , ""Afnistn""), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world.

Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world. New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors to produce morphine-like effects. Opioids are most often used medically to relieve pain, and by people addicted to opioids. Opioids include , an older term that refers to such drugs derived from , including morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms and are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. , derived from words meaning or , as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In other jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as ""narcotics"". The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where that is the case.
Primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia they are also used to suppress cough, suppress diarrhea, treat addiction, reverse opioid overdose, and suppress opioid induced constipation. Extremely strong opioids are approved only for veterinary use such as immobilizing large mammals. Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Opioid drugs include partial agonists and antagonists, which produce moderate or no effect (respectively) but displace other opioids from binding in those receptors.
The side effects of opioids may include itchiness, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Tolerance and dependence will develop with continuous use, requiring increasing doses and leading to a withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation. The euphoria attracts recreational use, and frequent, escalating recreational use of opioids typically results in addiction. Accidental overdose or concurrent use with other depressant drugs commonly results in death from respiratory depression. Because of opioid drugs' reputation for addiction and fatal overdose, most are controlled substances.
Illicit production, smuggling, and addiction to opioids prompted treaties, laws and policing which have realized limited success. In 2013 between 28 and 38 million people used opioids illicitly (0.6% to 0.8% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). In 2011 an estimated 4 million people in the United States used opioids recreationally or were dependent on them. Current increased rates of recreational use and addiction are attributed to over-prescription of opioid medications and inexpensive illicit heroin. Conversely, fears about over-prescribing, exaggerated side effects and addiction from opioids are similarly blamed for under-treatment of pain. Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause.
Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.
Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.
Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as ""the captain of the men of death"". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called ""the old man's friend"". Bangladesh ( , ""The country of Bengal""), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh (  ""Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh""), is a country in South Asia. It shares land borders with India and Myanmar (Burma). Nepal, Bhutan and China are located near Bangladesh but do not share a border with it. The country's maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal is roughly equal to the size of its land area. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous country. Dhaka is its capital and largest city, followed by Chittagong which has the country's largest port. The verb license or grant license means to give permission. The noun licence (British, Indian, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, or South African English) or license (American English) refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission. Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass. Constipation is a common cause of painful defecation. Severe constipation includes obstipation (failure to pass stools or gas) and fecal impaction, which can progress to bowel obstruction and become life-threatening. Naltrexone is a medication that reverses the effects of opioids and is used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant ""Papaver somniferum"".
The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. The term ""opiate"" should be differentiated from the broader term ""opioid,"" which includes all drugs with morphine-like effects, including opiates, semi-synthetic opioids derived from opiates (such as heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone), and synthetic opioids which are not derived from opiates (such as fentanyl, buprenorphine, and methadone). All opioids, including the opiates, are considered drugs of high abuse potential and are listed on various ""Substance-Control Schedules"" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States.

Chittagong (, Chatga) is a major coastal seaport city and financial centre in southeastern Bangladesh. The city has a population of more than 2.5 million while the metropolitan area has a population of over 6.5 million, making it the second largest city in the country. It is the capital of an eponymous district and division. The city is located on the banks of the Karnaphuli River between the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Bay of Bengal. Much of Chittagong Division is located within the ecological Indo-Burma zone on the boundary of the India Plate and Burma Plate. This makes Chittagong the crossroads of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The port city has been known by various names in history, including Chatigaon, Chatigam, Chattagrama, Islamabad, Chattala, Chaityabhumi and Porto Grande De Bengala. Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the ""funny bone"". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: ""Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage."" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. The Democratic Governors Association (DGA) is a Washington, D.C. based 527 organization founded in 1983, consisting of U.S. state and territorial governors affiliated with the Democratic Party. The mission of the organization is to provide party support to the election and re-election of Democratic gubernatorial candidates. The DGA's Republican counterpart is the Republican Governors Association. The DGA is not directly affiliated with the non-partisan National Governors Association. Elisabeth Pearson is currently the Executive Director of the DGA. Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also known as Burma, is a sovereign state in South East Asia bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. About one third of Myanmar's total perimeter of 5,876 km (3,651 miles), forms an uninterrupted coastline of 1,930 km (1,200 miles) along the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. The country's 2014 census revealed a much lower population than expected, with 51 million people recorded. Myanmar is 676,578 square kilometres (261,227 sq mi) in size. Its capital city is Naypyidaw and its largest city is Yangon (Rangoon). The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 is an international treaty to prohibit production and supply of specific (nominally narcotic) drugs and of drugs with similar effects except under licence for specific purposes, such as medical treatment and research. As noted below, its major effects included updating the Paris Convention of 13 July 1931 to include the vast number of synthetic opioids invented in the intervening thirty years and a mechanism for more easily including new ones. From 1931 to 1961, most of the families of synthetic opioids had been developed, including drugs in whatever way related to methadone, pethidine, morphinans and dextromoramide and related drugs; research on fentanyls and piritramide was also nearing fruition at that point. Bhutan ('), officially the Kingdom of Bhutan ('), is a landlocked country and the smallest state in Asia to be located entirely within the Himalaya mountain range. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by China in the north and India in the south. Bhutan lacks a border with nearby Nepal due to the Indian state of Sikkim and with Bangladesh due to the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam. Bhutan is geopolitically in South Asia and is the region's second least populous nation after the Maldives. Thimphu is its capital and largest city, while Phuntsholing is its financial center.  Smuggling is the illegal transportation of objects, substances, information or people, such as out of a house or buildings, into a prison, or across an international border, in violation of applicable laws or other regulations. Dhaka ( , or ) is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. It is one of the world's most populated cities, with a population of 17 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area. It is also 3rd densely populated city in the world. Located in an eponymous district and division, it lies along the east bank of the Buriganga River in the heart of the Bengal delta. The city is a microcosm of the entire country, with diverse religious and ethnic communities. Dhaka is the economic, cultural and political centre of Bangladesh. Its name was romanised as Dacca until the current spelling was adopted in 1983. It is the largest city in the Bengal region. It is also a major city of South Asia and among the OIC states. Bengal (bgl; Bengali: ,  and ) is a region in Asia which is located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal. Geographically, it is made up by the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta system, the largest such formation in the world; along with mountains in its north (bordering the Himalayan states) and east (bordering Northeast India and Burma). Opium (poppy tears, with the scientific name: ""Lachryma papaveris"") is the dried latex obtained from the opium poppy (scientific name: ""Papaver somniferum""). Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for the illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch (""score"") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word ""meconium"" (derived from the Greek for ""opium-like"", but now used to refer to infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies. Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.

Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as ""lo Stivale"" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. A still life (plural still lifes) is a work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural (food, flowers, dead animals, plants, rocks, or shells) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, and so on). With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Graeco-Roman art, still-life painting emerged as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century, and has remained significant since then. Still life gives the artist more freedom in the arrangement of elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture. Early still-life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. Some modern still life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media, and uses found objects, photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound. Mario Nuzzi, or Mario de' Fiori (1603 in Penne, Province of Pescara1673 in Rome) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active mainly in Rome. He was a pupil of the painter Tommaso Salini. He was among the first Italians specializing in still life painting of flower arrangements. He also painted a celebrated ""Concert of Birds"", an often repeated model which here arranges an encyclopedic diversity of realistically depicted fowl on branches as a chorus around an owl. Rome is a city and special ""comune"" (named ""Roma Capitale"") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated ""comune"" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.  Laura Bernasconi was an Italian painter of the Baroque period , known to be active in 1674 . Born and died in Rome , she trained with Mario Nuzzi , and like him , painted still life paintings of flowers . This same thematic had been favored by Giovanna Garzoni , another woman painter in Rome who died in 1670 . Lazio (; ) is one of the 20 administrative regions of Italy, situated in the central peninsular section of the country. With almost 5.9 million residents and a GDP of more than 170 billion euros, Lazio is the second most populated region of Italy (having approximately the same in population as Campania), and has the second largest economy of the nation. Its capital is Rome, capital and largest city of Italy. Computer graphics are pictures and films created using computers. Usually, the term refers to computer-generated image data created with help from specialized graphical hardware and software. It is a vast and recent area in computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960, by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, though sometimes erroneously referred to as CGI. ]
Giovanna Garzoni (1600-1670) was an Italian painter who was prominent in Europe during the Baroque period. Garzoni started her career painting religious, mythological, and allegorical subjects but became famous for her works with tempera and watercolors of botanical subjects. The artist rose to prominence due to her precision and balance with space and scientific realism of her subjects. Garzoni was often called the Chaste Giovanna due to her vow to remain a virgin. Garzoni is also notable for being one the few women who opted to travel throughout Europe and receive an education during the 17th century instead of settling down and starting a family. Scholars have speculated Garzoni may have been influenced by fellow botanical painter Jacopo Ligozzi although details about Garzoni's training are widely unknown. The Baroque (or ) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome and Italy, and spread to most of Europe. Tommaso Salini (1575  13 September 1625) was an Italian painter of the early-Baroque period, active in Rome. He is best remembered for defending his friend, Giovanni Baglione, in his libel suit against Caravaggio and other painters in his circle. Baglioni describes his still life paintings. He joined the Accademia di San Luca in 1605. Salini is a frequently forgotten Baroque artist who fell under the spell of Caravaggio, despite having a tempestuous relationship with the great painter. Salini, also known as Mao, was a friend of Giovanni Baglione, the Italian art biographer, who included Salini in his ""Le vite de pittori."" Art historians have often shied away from exploring Salinis career because the canvases that have carried his name seem stylistically dissimilar. The recent tendency has been to attribute these works to anonymous ""Pseudo-Salini"" painters. In order for Salinis ""oeuvre"" to be presented with accuracy, connoisseurs have had to inspect the original works that Baglione mentions as being by Salinis hand, as well as the pictures that have been successfully attributed to him. Jacopo Ligozzi (15471627) was an Italian painter, illustrator, designer, and miniaturist. His art can be categorized as late-Renaissance and Mannerist styles. Tempera, also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium (usually a glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other size). Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long lasting, and examples from the 1st centuries AD still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting. A paint consisting of pigment and glue size commonly used in the United States as poster paint is also often referred to as ""tempera paint,"" although the binders and sizes in this paint are different from traditional tempera paint."

HMAS Kurumba was an oil tanker operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1919 to 1946. Built by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson in 1916, Kurumba served in the Royal Navy's Royal Fleet Auxiliary during World War I and was transferred to the Royal Australian Fleet Auxiliary in 1919. She operated in Australian and South-East Asia waters until being paid off to reserve in 1928. Reactivated in 1939, Kurumba served in World War II, operating in Australian waters and the South-West Pacific Area. After the war, she was sold to Artemis Maritime Co Inc in 1948 and renamed Angeliki. In 1955, she was sold to Pappas Eleftheriades and renamed Evangelos. She was broken up in 1966.

Oil tankers are merchant ships designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types: crude tankers, which move large quantities of unrefined crude oil, and product tankers, which transport refined products. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), consisting of the RAN, Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and several 'tri-service' units.

","Monty Python (sometimes known as The Pythons) were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"", which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and a stage musical. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. The ""Orlando Sentinel"" referred to their sketch show as ""not only one of the more enduring icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy."" SEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA). It is used broadly throughout South Korean industry, but seldom found elsewhere. It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard. However, this decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea, as no major SSL libraries or web browsers supported the SEED algorithm, requiring users to use an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer for secure web sites. The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as ""Beatlemania"", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word ""cult"" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an ""ad hominem"" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term ""botany"" comes from the Ancient Greek word (""botan"") meaning ""pasture"", ""grass"", or ""fodder""; is in turn derived from (""boskein""), ""to feed"" or ""to graze"". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. The Orlando Sentinel is the primary newspaper of Orlando, Florida and the Central Florida region. It was founded in 1876. The ""Sentinel"" is owned by Tribune Publishing. Monty Pythons Flying Circus (known during the final series as just Monty Python) is a British sketch comedy series created by the comedy group Monty Python and broadcast by the BBC from 1969 to 1974. The shows were composed of surreality, risqué or innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. It also featured animations by group member Terry Gilliam, often sequenced or merged with live action. The first episode was recorded on 7 September and premiered on 5 October 1969 on BBC One, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term ""angiosperm"" comes from the Greek composite word (""angeion"", ""case"" or ""casing"", and ""sperma"", ""seed"") meaning ""enclosed seeds"", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. `` Self - Defence Against Fresh Fruit '' is a Monty Python sketch that appeared in the episode `` Owl Stretching Time '' . It is about an RSM - type instructor who is teaching a class about self - defence , but all he teaches is how to defend oneself against an assailant `` armed '' with a piece of fresh fruit . The first half or so of the sketch was remade for the Pythons ' first feature film , And Now for Something Completely Different . Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called ""sketches"", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.

The Carmelites are one of the significant orders of friars, alongside the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, and Carmelites. The term ""charism"" refers to the unique contribution of each religious order, which in the case of the Carmelites, is defined by the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder, Augustine of Hippo.

The Franciscan Order, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi, is another prominent group of mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church. The Franciscan Order includes the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. These orders follow the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder and his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary.

Felix of Cantalice, born in 1515 in Italy, was the first Capuchin friar to be canonized as a saint by Pope Clement XI in 1712. The Capuchin friars are a branch of the Franciscan Order, and their charism is based on the teachings and spiritual disciplines of their founder, Saint Francis of Assisi.

In summary, the Carmelites, Franciscans, and Capuchin friars are all significant orders of friars within the Catholic Church, each with their unique charism and spiritual disciplines. These orders have been influential in shaping the religious landscape of the Church and continue to play a vital role in the lives of their members and the communities they serve. ","Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole.
Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as ""Amérique latine"" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere.  The Southern Hemisphere is the half sphere of Earth which is south of the equator. It contains all or parts of five continents (Antarctica, Australia, about 90% of South America, the southern third of Africa, and several southern islands off the continental mainland of Asia), four oceans (Indian, South Atlantic, Southern, and South Pacific) and most of the Pacific Islands in Oceania. Its surface is 80.9% water, compared with 60.7% water in the case of the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains 32.7% of Earth's land. Oopoochawa or Opochawa , also known as quisanche ( Montevideo , Uruguay ) is a type of mbira or lamellaphone from South America . The Romance languages (sometimes called the Romanic languages, Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family. The mbira is an African musical instrument consisting of a wooden board (often fitted with a resonator) with attached staggered metal tines, played by holding the instrument in the hands and plucking the tines with the thumbs. The mbira is usually classified as part of the lamellaphone family, and part of the idiophone family of musical instruments. The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the ""New World"".  South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection."

","Charles Martel (c. 686  22 October 741) was a Frankish statesman and military leader who as Duke and Prince of the Franks and Mayor of the Palace, was ""de facto"" ruler of Francia from 718 until his death. The son of the Frankish statesman Pepin of Herstal and a noblewoman named Alpaida, Charles successfully asserted his claims to power as successor to his father as the power behind the throne in Frankish politics. Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul. Under the Merovingian dynasty, the mayor of the palace or majordomo (""maior domus"") was the manager of the household of the Frankish king. The office existed from the sixth century, and during the seventh it evolved into the ""power behind the throne"" in the northeastern kingdom of Austrasia. In 751, the mayor of the palace, Pepin the Short, orchestrated the deposition of the king, Childeric III, and was crowned in his place. Alpaida (also Alphaida, Alpoïde, Elphide, Elfide, Chalpaida; ca. 654  ca. 714) was a noblewoman of the House of Pepin, who hailed from the Liège area. The daughter of Alberic of Austrasia and Adèle of Poiters, she was Pepin II's (635 or 640  December 16, 714) second wife and mother to two sons, Charles Martel (Charles the Hammer) (d.

Located in the German southeast with an area of 70,548 square kilometres (27,200 sq mi), Bavaria is the largest German state. Its territory comprises roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany, and, with 12.9 million inhabitants, it is Germany's second most populous state. Munich, Bavaria's capital and largest city, is the third largest city in Germany. Gaul (Latin: ""Gallia"") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania.
Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC.
During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. Munich (also in British English ) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Bavaria, on the banks of River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps. Munich is the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and the 12th biggest city of the European Union, with a population of above 1.5 million.

After the death of Charles , she supported her son 's failed attempt to gain a portion of his inheritance . This she did with the support of her uncle Odilo of Bavaria . Afterwards she was relegated to the position of abbess of Chelles . Although later Carolingian historians cast her as a concubine , she was during her time the rightful wife of Charles . The Reichenau Codex listed her as Suanahil regina , `` Queen Swanachild . '' Pepin II (c. 635  16 December 714), commonly known as Pepin of Herstal, was a Frankish statesman and military leader who de facto ruled Francia as the Mayor of the Palace from 680 until his death.

Its activities include campaign work on issues including opposition to intensive farming, support for local purchasing and public education on nutrition; as well the certification of organic food. It developed
the world's first organic certification system in 1967  standards which have since widened to encompass agriculture, aquaculture, ethical trade, food processing, forestry, health & beauty, horticulture and textiles. Today it certifies over 80% of organic produce in the UK. Food security is a condition related to the supply of food, and individuals' access to it. Concerns over food security have existed throughout history. There is evidence of granaries being in use over 10,000 years ago, with central authorities in civilizations including ancient China and ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 World Food Conference the term ""food security"" was defined with an emphasis on supply. Food security, they said, is the ""availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices"". Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security ""exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life"". Organic farming is an alternative agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Organic agriculture continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today. It relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as compost, manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting. Biological pest control, mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. In general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances. For instance, naturally occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin and rotenone are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are generally prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed include, for example, copper sulfate, elemental sulfur and Ivermectin. Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited. Reasons for advocation of organic farming include real or perceived advantages in sustainability, openness, self-sufficiency, autonomy/independence, health, food security, and food safety, although the match between perception and reality is continually challenged. Henry Rolf Gardiner ( 5 November 1902 -- 1971 ) was an English rural revivalist , helping to bring back folk dance styles including Morris dancing and sword dancing . He founded groups significant in the British history of organic farming . He was said to have sympathised with Nazism and participated in inter-war far right politics , but this was speculation based on his approval of the German Youth Movement 's aims of involving townspeople in country community life , such as helping with the harvest . He organised summer camps with music , dance and community aims across class and cultures . His forestry methods were far ahead of their time and he was a founder member of The Soil Association ."

It is now in the Prado . There is some controversy as to its date , with some scholars believing it was made during the artist 's first trip to Italy ( 1629 - 31 ) and others feeling its advanced technique must mean it belongs to his second trip ( 1649 - 51 ) . There is another version with similar features and the same title , and the two are of similar size and vary little in their execution and manner of depicting the garden . Landscape painting was rare in Spanish painting of this time , with most commissions being religious works or portraits , and so Velázquez was somewhat cut off from the mainstream of French and Italian landscape art as practised by Claude Lorrain or Poussin for example ) , making his use of an oil sketch rather than an easel - painted work unusual . Such a revolution put him 200 years ahead of the Impressionist painters in choosing landscape as a topic , then showing interest in light , nature and their interconnectedness , and finally in his pictorial technique ( abandoning detail to stain rather than paint , with little touches of the brush better appreciated stood further back from the painting than too close to it ) . Velázquez thus showed that he was not only a good painter for his mastery of technique but also his innovation , ahead of its time and nationally and internationally revolutionising other painters ' way of painting . The French Academy in Rome is an Academy located in the Villa Medici, within the Villa Borghese, on the Pincio (Pincian Hill) in Rome, Italy.

Las Meninas (Spanish for The Ladies-in-Waiting) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, ""Las Meninas"" has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting.

","Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. In Norse mythology , Baugi is a giant . He is the son of Gilling , brother of Suttungr and paternal uncle of Gunnlöð . Baugi is attested to in Skáldskaparmál in Snorri 's Prose Edda , and does not appear in other texts . Due to his absence in other relevant mythological texts , numerous scholars have argued that Baugi either comes from a source that is not extant today or was an invention of Snorri 's , accidental or intentional . Germanic mythology consists of the body of myths native to the Germanic peoples. Commonly featuring narratives focused on Germanic deities and a large variety of other entities, Germanic mythology dates from the Proto-Germanic period and reaches beyond the Christianization of the Germanic peoples and into modern Germanic folklore. Germanic mythology includes Norse mythology, Anglo-Saxon mythology, and Continental Germanic mythology. Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. In Norse mythology, Suttungr was a ""jötunn"", a son of Gilling, who (along with Suttungr's mother) had been murdered by Fjalar and Galar. The jötunn (anglicized jotunn or jotun, plural jötnar , or ; Old Norse jtunn , Icelandic jötunn ; often glossed as ""giant"" or ""ettin"") are a mythological race that live in Jötunheimr, one of the nine worlds of Norse cosmology. They were banished there by the Æsir who refused them entry to their world, Asgard. The Jötnar can be seen throughout Norse mythology. They frequently interact with the Æsir, as well as the Vanir. They are usually in opposition to, or in competition with them, but also interact with them in a non-hostile manner. Some Jötnar even intermarry with the Æsir and Vanir, and many are named as parents or grandparents of Æsir such as Thor and Odin. This very complex relationship between these two comparable races develops most notably in the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, ultimately making it difficult to distinguish them from the more familiar Norse gods."

Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to ""put forward views and proposals"" with ""determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments"". Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom.

Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny. The uterus, also known as the womb, is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ in humans and most other mammals. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. The nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils and is responsible for respiration. Altricial species are those whose young are incapable of moving around on their own soon after birth or hatching. Mammals are vertebrates with specific characteristics such as a neocortex, hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands. The skeleton provides support and protection to the body, while muscles enable movement and maintain posture. Joints connect bones and allow for movement. Birth, or parturition, is the process of bringing forth offspring, which in mammals is initiated by hormones. Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside the female's uterus. Cartilage is a resilient tissue that forms a part of the skeletal system. Hormones are signaling molecules that regulate physiology and behavior. White blood cells are involved in protecting the body against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. Bones are rigid organs that constitute part of the vertebrate skeleton, providing support, protection, and enabling movement. The ear is the organ of hearing and balance in mammals. Marsupials are mammals with distinctive characteristics, including carrying their young in a pouch. Precocial species are those whose young are relatively mature and mobile from birth or hatching. Atelosteogenesis, type II, is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. The Trampoline World Championships are the World Championships for trampolining. They were originally held annually from 1964-1968. The frequency was switched to biennially from 1970-1998.

Literature is any written work that is considered an art form or has intellectual value. It can be classified as fiction or non-fiction, and as poetry or prose. Works are often categorized according to major forms such as the novel, short story, or drama, and historical periods or aesthetic features.

Imitation is an advanced behavior where individuals observe and replicate another's behavior. It is a form of social learning that allows for the transfer of information, such as behaviors and customs, between individuals and down generations without the need for genetic inheritance.

A film, also called a motion picture, is a series of still images that create the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry, with films being created by photographing actual scenes, drawings, or miniature models using traditional animation techniques or CGI and computer animation.

Parody is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work's subject, author, style, or some other target through satiric or ironic imitation. It can be found in various art forms, including literature, music, animation, gaming, and film. Parody is not always at the expense of the parodied text, as it can also provide polemical allusions and critique. ","Lycaenidae is the second-largest family of butterflies (behind Nymphalidae, brush-footed butterflies), with over 6,000 species worldwide, whose members are also called gossamer-winged butterflies. They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species. Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just ""binomial""), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens"". The ""formal"" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work ""Species Plantarum"" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book ""Pinax theatri botanici"" (English, ""Illustrated exposition of plants"") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.

The position is elected to a four-year term, coinciding with the elections for Governor and other offices. ","The Arecaceae are a botanical family of perennial climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees commonly known as palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae). They are flowering plants, a family in the monocot order Arecales. Currently 181 genera with around 2600 species are known, most of them restricted to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts. A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.

Rattan (from the Malay ""rotan"") is the name for roughly 600 species of old world climbing palms belonging to subfamily Calamoideae (from the Greek 'kálamos' = reed). Rattan is also known as ""manila"", or ""malacca"", named after the ports of shipment Manila and Malacca City, and as ""manau"" (from the Malay ""rotan manau"", the trade name for ""Calamus manan"" canes in Southeast Asia). The climbing habit is associated with the characteristics of its woody stem, soft and flexible comparing to true wood derived from a typical secondary growth. Daemonorops is a genus of rattan palms in the family Arecaceae found primarily in the tropics and subtropics of southeastern Asia with a few species extending into southern China and the Himalayas. Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands.

In botany, phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem (from Ancient Greek ""phýllon"" ""leaf"" and ""táxis"" ""arrangement""). Phyllotactic spirals form a distinctive class of patterns in nature. An inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches. Morphologically, it is the part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed and which is accordingly modified. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes.
Inflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern. India, officially the Republic of India (""Bhrat Gaarjya""), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. Connation in plants is the developmental fusion of organs of the same type, for example, petals to one another to form a tubular corolla. This is in contrast to adnation, the fusion of dissimilar organs. Such organs are described as connate or adnate, respectively. When like organs that are usually well separated are placed next to each other, but not actually connected, they are described as connivent (that is the case for anthers in several genera, such as ""Solanum""). Ceratolobus is a dioecious genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in Southeast Asia , commonly called rotan . They are only differentiated from close relatives like Korthalsia , Calamus , and Daemonorops by leaf sheath appendages or inflorescence variations . The Greek genus name combines `` horn '' and `` capsule '' . Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity.

It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term ""angiosperm"" comes from the Greek composite word (""angeion"", ""case"" or ""casing"", and ""sperma"", ""seed"") meaning ""enclosed seeds"", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion. Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. Korthalsia is a clustering genus of flowering plant in the palm family spread throughout Southeast Asia. It is a highly specialized rattan with some species known to have an intimate relationship with ants, hence the common name ant rattan. High-climbing and armed with spines, the genus is named for the Dutch botanist P. W. Korthals who first collected them from Indonesia.  In botany, shoots consist of stems including their appendages, the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds. The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants.

They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term ""fish"" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. A marina (from Spanish , Portuguese and Italian : ""marina"", ""coast"" or ""shore"") is a dock or basin with moorings and supplies for yachts and small boats.
A marina differs from a port in that a marina does not handle large passenger ships or cargo from freighters. Middelfart is a town in central Denmark, with a population of 14,815 (1 January 2014). The town is the municipal seat of Middelfart Municipality on the island of Funen. Pollock (alternatively and more commonly among anglers spelled as ""pollack""; pronounced ) is the common name used for either of the two species of North Atlantic marine fish in the genus Pollachius. ""Pollachius pollachius"" is referred to as pollock in both North America and United Kingdom, while ""Pollachius virens"" today is usually known as coley in the British Isles (derived from the older name coalfish). Other names for ""P. pollachius"" include the Atlantic pollock, European pollock, lieu jaune, and lythe; while ""P. virens"" is also known as Boston blues (distinct from bluefish), silver bills or saithe. Salmonidae is a family of ray-finned fish, the only living family currently placed in the order Salmoniformes. It includes salmon, trout, chars, freshwater whitefishes, and graylings, which collectively are known as the salmonids. The Atlantic salmon and trout of the genus ""Salmo"" give the family and order their names. Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term ""continent"" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. A ""retailer"" or a ""shop"" is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods. Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. In some contexts it may be considered a leisure activity as well as an economic one. A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. Salvelinus is a genus of salmonid fish often called char or charr; some species are called ""trout"". ""Salvelinus"" is a member of the Salmoninae subfamily of the Salmonidae family. The genus has a northern circumpolar distribution, and most of its members are typically cold-water fish that primarily inhabit fresh waters. Many species also migrate to the sea, however. An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word ""sea"" is often used interchangeably with ""ocean"" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. Region of Southern Denmark is an administrative region of Denmark established on Monday 1 January 2007 as part of the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, which replaced the traditional counties (""amter"") with five larger regions. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 271 before 1 January 2006 to 98. The reform was implemented in Denmark on 1 January 2007, although the merger of the Funish municipalities of Ærøskøbing and Marstal, being a part of the reform, was given the go-ahead to be implemented on Sunday 1 January 2006, one year before the main reform.

The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., ""The North""). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.
Businesses as a form of economic activity are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services to customers in exchange for other goods, services, or money. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises charged by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities. A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. Gadus is a genus of demersal fish in the family Gadidae, commonly known as cod, although there are additional cod species in other genera. The best known member of the genus is the Atlantic cod. Middelfart Municipality is a municipality (Danish, ""kommune"") in Region of Southern Denmark on the west coast of the island of Funen in southern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 297 km². It has a total population of 37,274 (2008). Its mayor is Steen Dahlstrøm, a member of the Social Democrats (""Socialdemokraterne"") political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Middelfart. Trout is the common name for a number of species of freshwater fish belonging to the genera ""Oncorhynchus"", ""Salmo"" and ""Salvelinus"", all of the subfamily Salmoninae of the family Salmonidae. The word ""trout"" is also used as part of the name of some non-salmonid fish such as ""Cynoscion nebulosus"", the spotted seatrout or speckled trout. A navigational aid (also known as aid to navigation, ATON, or navaid) is any sort of marker which aids the traveler in navigation; the term is most commonly used to refer to nautical or aviation travel. Common types of such aids include lighthouses, buoys, fog signals, and day beacons. Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: ""Norgga""), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east. In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case. Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). Arable land (from Latin ""arabilis"", ""able to be plowed"") is, according to one definition, land ""capable"" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016). An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word ""archipelago"" is derived from the Greek ""-  arkhi-"" (""chief"") and ""  pélagos"" (""sea"") through the Italian ""arcipelago"". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek ""*"" and Latin ""archipelagus"") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus ""Salmo"") and Pacific Ocean (genus ""Oncorhynchus""). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world. The Faroe Islands (Irish: ""Na Scigirí"") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. Fredericia is a town located in Fredericia municipality in the eastern part of the Jutland peninsula in Denmark, in a sub-region known locally as ""Trekanten"", or ""The Triangle"". It was founded in 1650 by Frederick III, after whom it was named.  Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark.
It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there. The Gadidae are a family of marine fish, included in the order Gadiformes, known as the cods, codfishes or true cods. It contains several commercially important fishes, including the cod, haddock, whiting, and pollock. Salmo is a genus of fish in the salmon family Salmonidae that includes the European species of salmon and trout, among them the familiar Atlantic salmon ""Salmo salar"" and the brown trout ""Salmo trutta"". The natural distribution of ""Salmo"" also extends to Northern Africa and to Western Asia around the Black Sea basin. The single ""Salmo"" species naturally found in the Atlantic North America is the Atlantic salmon, whereas the salmon and trout of the Pacific basin belong to another genus, ""Oncorhynchus"". The generic name ""Salmo"" derives from the Latin ""salm"" (salmon). The number of distinct species and subspecies in ""Salmo"" is a debated issue. Atlantic salmon and brown trout are widespread species, while most of the other taxa are narrowly distributed forms endemic to single watersheds. Oncorhynchus is a genus of fish in the family Salmonidae; it contains the Pacific salmon and Pacific trout. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek ""onkos"" (""hook"") and ""rynchos"" (""nose""), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the ""kype""). A wave pool is a swimming pool in which there are artificially generated, reasonably large waves, similar to those of the ocean. Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks. Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world. Surfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools. A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses, and to serve as a navigational aid for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways. Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. Demersal fish live and feed on or near the bottom of seas or lakes (the demersal zone). They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word ""demersal"" comes from the Latin ""demergere"", which means ""to sink"".
Demersal fish are bottom feeders. They can be contrasted with pelagic fish which live and feed away from the bottom in the open water column. Demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil (one to four percent), whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. Odense Steel Shipyard was a Danish shipbuilding company located in Odense. It was best known for building container ships for its parent group, A.P. Moller  Maersk Group, including the Mærsk E-class in 2006 which at the time were the biggest container ships in the world. The global financial crisis led to Maersk announcing its closure in 2009 and the last new ship was delivered in January 2012. A tidal bore, often simply given as bore in context, is a tidal phenomenon in which the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travels up a river or narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay's current. Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as"" 'slack water levels',"" often just called 'levels'.
The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of ""deep enough"" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. Fredericia municipality is a municipality (Danish, ""kommune"") on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula in south-central Denmark. It belongs to Region of Southern Denmark, covers an area of 134.46 km², and has a total population of 49,463 (2008). The Mayor is Jacob Bjerregaard, representing the Social Democrats (Denmark) political party. Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time."

She was mother of his two immediate successors, Charles II and James II. Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the ""Old Dominion"" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and ""Mother of Presidents"" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.

A spring house, or springhouse, is a small building, usually of a single room, constructed over a spring. While the original purpose of a springhouse was to keep the spring water clean by excluding fallen leaves, animals, etc., the enclosing structure was also used for refrigeration before the advent of ice delivery and, later, electric refrigeration. The water of the spring maintains a constant cool temperature inside the spring house throughout the year. Food that would otherwise spoil, such as meat, fruit, or dairy products, could be kept there, safe from animal depredations as well.

280,What is the original language of the work 'Ice Men'?,english,"['english', 'german', 'greek']"," Cotton, a cellulose-based fiber, is cultivated in the genus Gossypium and is used to create textiles through weaving, knitting, and braiding. A loom, a device that holds warp threads under tension, is essential for weaving cloth, which is a woven fabric made of warp and weft threads. Knitting involves interlacing yarn to create a textile, while braiding interlaces multiple strands to form a patterned structure.

Community radio stations, such as WEFT Champaign 90.1FM, serve specific geographic communities by broadcasting content relevant to their interests. These stations are nonprofit and allow individuals to create and contribute to media.

Textiles are flexible materials made from natural or artificial fibers, such as wool, cotton, or synthetic fibers. Wool is obtained from sheep and other animals, while felt is a textile made by matting fibers together. Crochet is a fabric-making technique that involves interlocking loops of yarn using a crochet hook. Tapestry is a form of textile art, traditionally woven on a vertical loom, where weft threads of different colors are interlaced to form a design.

Cloth is a woven fabric made of warp and weft threads, and it can be produced using various methods, including loom weaving, tablet weaving, and braiding.

","Technology (""science of craft"", from Greek , ""techne"", ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and , ""-logia"") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. Sir Richard Arkwright ( 23 December 1732 in Preston , - 3 August 1792 in Cromford ) was an inventor and a leading entrepreneur during the early Industrial Revolution . Although the patents were eventually overturned , he is credited with inventing the spinning frame , which , following the transition to water power , was renamed the water frame . He also patented a rotary carding engine that transformed raw cotton into cotton lap. Arkwright 's achievement was to combine power , machinery , semi-skilled labour and the new raw material ( cotton ) to create mass - produced yarn . His skills of organization made him , more than anyone else , the creator of the modern factory system , especially in his mill at Cromford , Derbyshire . Later in his life Arkwright was known as ' the Father of the Industrial Revolution ' . The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development. The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. The water frame is the name given to a water-powered spinning frame which was an easy way to create cotton thread. The first time the machine was used in 1768. It was able to spin 128 threads at a time, which was an easier and faster method than ever before. It was developed by Richard Arkwright, who patented the technology in 1767. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas Highs by clock maker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright."

The battle took place near the town of Battle, East Sussex, and resulted in a decisive Norman victory led by William, the Duke of Normandy, over the Anglo-Saxon forces under King Harold II. This victory led to the Norman conquest of England and the end of Anglo-Saxon rule.

The battle site, located in the designated High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, is now a popular tourist attraction. The town of Battle, with a population of 6,673 according to the 2011 Census, is home to two senior schools and is a historic town with a rich heritage.

The Battle of Hastings re-enactment in 2000 attracted over 1,500 participants from 16 different countries, highlighting the global interest in this pivotal event. The next major re-enactment took place in 2006, further cementing the battle's significance in history.

Normandy, a region in France, was the homeland of William, the Duke of Normandy, who later became William I of England. The Norman conquest of England, which began with the Battle of Hastings, had a profound impact on the country's culture, language, and governance.

The battle site near Battle, East Sussex, remains a symbol of the Norman conquest and a reminder of the significant changes that took place in England in 1066. ","London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it ""Londinium"". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, ""London"" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province. Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest.  The Literary and Historical Society of Quebec (LHSQ) was the first scholarly or learned society in Canada. It was founded in 1824 by George Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, governor of British North America. Its headquarters are still located in Quebec City. In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term ""tundra"" comes through Russian  (""tûndra"") from the Kildin Sami word ""tndâr"" ""uplands"", ""treeless mountain tract"". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called ""Ville-Marie"", or ""City of Mary,"" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Edmund Allen Meredith CMG ( 7 October 1817 -- 2 January 1899 ) was Under Secretary of State for Canada ; a prison reformer , writer , amateur scientist , president of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec and the third principal of McGill University from 1846 to 1853 . The diary he kept from 1844 until his death is preserved in the National Archives of Canada and formed the basis for the first half of Sandra Gwyn 's book The Private Capital : Ambition and Love in the Age of Macdonald and Laurier ( 1985 ) , which the CBC later made into a television series . An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since ""the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law"", the term ""official language"" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government. A learned society (also known as a learned academy, scholarly society or academic association) is an organization that exists to promote an academic discipline or profession, or a group of related disciplines or professions. Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualification, or may be an honor conferred by election. A university (""a whole"", ""a corporation"") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. 
Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. James McGill (October 6, 1744  December 19, 1813) was a British businessman and philanthropist best known for being the founder of McGill University, Montreal. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Montreal West in 1792 and was appointed to the Executive Council of Lower Canada in 1793. He was the first honorary Lieutenant-Colonel of The Canadian Grenadier Guards. He was also a prominent member of the Château Clique and one of the original founding members of the Beaver Club. His summer home stood within the Golden Square Mile. The Secretary of State for Canada was a Canadian Cabinet position with a corresponding department. It was established in 1867 as the official channel of communication between the Dominion of Canada and the Imperial government in London. As Canada became increasingly independent after World War I and particularly with the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 this role fell into disuse. A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate ""real world"" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.  Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. A diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, and/or thoughts or feelings, including comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. ""Hansard""), business ledgers and military records. In British English, the word may also denote a preprinted journal format. A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011. FOREST (short for ""Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco"") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. A ledger is the principal book or computer file for recording and totaling economic transactions measured in terms of a monetary unit of account by account type, with debits and credits in separate columns and a beginning monetary balance and ending monetary balance for each account. Alexandra Sandra Fraser Gwyn, (17 May 1935  26 May 2000) was a Canadian journalist and writer. McGill University is an English and French-language public research university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, ranked among the world's top 30 institutions. It was established in 1821 by royal charter, issued by King George IV of Great Britain. The University bears the name of James McGill, a prominent Montreal merchant from Scotland whose bequest in 1813 formed the university's precursor, McGill College. British North America refers to the former territories of the British Empire in mainland North America. The term was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. These territories today form modern-day Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. British colonization of North America (including colonization by both the English and the Scots), began in 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia and reached its peak when colonies had been established throughout the Americas. The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. Hansard is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary Debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after Thomas Curson Hansard (17761833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the parliament at Westminster."

","Robert Nozick (November 16, 1938  January 23, 2002) was an American philosopher. He held the Joseph Pellegrino University Professorship at Harvard University, and was president of the American Philosophical Association. He is best known for his book ""Anarchy, State, and Utopia"" (1974), a libertarian answer to John Rawls' ""A Theory of Justice"" (1971). His other work involved decision theory and epistemology. Decision theory (or the theory of choice) is the study of the reasoning underlying an agent's choices. Decision theory can be broken into two branches: normative decision theory, which gives advice on how to make the best decisions, given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of values; and descriptive decision theory, which analyzes how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. Socratic Puzzles is a 1997 collection of essays by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick . Theology is the critical study of the nature of the divine. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities, seminaries and schools of divinity. The American Philosophical Association (APA) is the main professional organization for philosophers in the United States. Founded in 1900, its mission is to promote the exchange of ideas among philosophers, to encourage creative and scholarly activity in philosophy, to facilitate the professional work and teaching of philosophers, and to represent philosophy as a discipline. Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. Anarchy, State, and Utopia is a 1974 book by the American political philosopher Robert Nozick. It won the 1975 U.S. National Book Award in category Philosophy and Religion,
has been translated into 11 languages, and was named one of the ""100 most influential books since the war"" (19451995) by the U.K. ""Times Literary Supplement"". The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC. John Bordley Rawls (February 21, 1921  November 24, 2002) was an American moral and political philosopher. He held the James Bryant Conant University Professorship at Harvard University and the Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Oxford. Rawls received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal in 1999, the latter presented by President Bill Clinton, in recognition of how Rawls's work ""helped a whole generation of learned Americans revive their faith in democracy itself."" A Theory of Justice is a work of political philosophy and ethics by John Rawls, in which Rawls attempts to solve the problem of distributive justice (the socially just distribution of goods in a society) by utilising a variant of the familiar device of the social contract. The resultant theory is known as ""Justice as Fairness"", from which Rawls derives his two principles of justice: ""the liberty principle"" and ""the difference principle"". First published in 1971, ""A Theory of Justice"" was revised in both 1975 (for the translated editions) and 1999. Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636, whose history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities. A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term ""philosopher"" comes from the Ancient Greek (""philosophos"") meaning ""lover of wisdom"". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. Philosophy (from Greek , ""philosophia"", literally ""love of wisdom"") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?"
285,What is the streak color of pyrrhotite?,black,"['black', 'white', 'yellow']"," En carne viva is a 1954 Argentine film directed by Enrique Cahen Salaberry and starring Alberto Closas and Ana Mariscal. Alberto Closas, a prolific Spanish film actor, appeared in the Cinema of Argentina during the 1940s and 1950s, and later in Spanish cinema after 1955. Barcelona, the capital city of Catalonia in Spain, is the second most populous municipality in the country, with a population of around 4.7 million people within its urban area. It is the largest metropolis on the Mediterranean Sea, located between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.

Ana Mariscal, a classic Spanish film actress, director, screenwriter, and film producer, was also involved in acting in Argentine films. She was born in 1923 and passed away in 1995. The film En carne viva, which translates to ""In Living Color,"" showcases the talents of both Closas and Mariscal, and is a significant part of Argentine and Spanish cinema history. ","Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). Pyrrhotite is an iron sulfide mineral with the formula Fe ( 1 - x ) S ( x = 0 to 0.2 ) . It is a nonstoichiometric variant of FeS , the mineral known as troilite . Pyrrhotite is also called magnetic pyrite , because the color is similar to pyrite and it is weakly magnetic . The magnetism decreases as the iron content increase , and troilite is non-magnetic . Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys. The prefix """" refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, FeO. Nickel is a chemical element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickeliron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere. Sulfur or sulphur (see spelling and etymology) is a chemical element with symbol S and atomic number 16. It is abundant, multivalent, and nonmetalic. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with chemical formula S. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow crystalline solid at room temperature. Chemically, sulfur reacts with all elements except for gold, platinum, iridium, tellurium, and the noble gases. Iron sulfide or Iron sulphide can refer to a range of chemical compounds composed of iron and sulfur. Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS. This mineral's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of ""fool's gold"". The color has also led to the nicknames ""brass"", ""brazzle"", and ""Brazil"", primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal."

The party avoided using the term Conservative until 1965. Wigtownshire was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. It was represented by one Member of Parliament. Hew Hamilton Dalrymple, the son of John Dalrymple, 10th Earl of Stair, won the seat at a by-election in 1915 and held it until it was abolished in 1918.

The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favor of a single parliament located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This arrangement lasted nearly a century until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom, effective from 1 January 1801.

Scotland is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, Scotland is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. ","The humerus (Plural: ""humeri"") is a long bone in the arm or forelimb that runs from the shoulder to the elbow. It connects the scapula and the two bones of the lower arm, the radius and ulna, and consists of three sections. The humeral upper extremity consists of a rounded head, a narrow neck, and two short processes (tubercles, sometimes called tuberosities). The body is cylindrical in its upper portion, and more prismatic below. The lower extremity consists of 2 epicondyles, 2 processes (trochlea & capitulum), and 3 fossae (radial fossa, coronoid fossa, and olecranon fossa). As well as its true anatomical neck, the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus is referred to as its surgical neck due to its tendency to fracture, thus often becoming the focus of surgeons. Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. The radial fossa is a slight depression found on the humerus above the front part of the capitulum. It receives the anterior border of the head of the radius when the forearm is flexed. Quetzalcoatlus northropi is an azhdarchid pterosaur known from the Late Cretaceous of North America (Maastrichtian stage) and one of the largest known flying animals of all time. It is a member of the family Azhdarchidae, a family of advanced toothless pterosaurs with unusually long, stiffened necks. Its name comes from the Mesoamerican feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl. The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation ""Kreide"" (chalk). Pterosaurs (meaning ""winged lizard"") are flying reptiles of the extinct clade or order Pterosauria. They existed from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous (228 to 66 million years ago). Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. Early species had long, fully toothed jaws and long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats made up of hair-like filaments known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pterosaurs spanned a wide range of adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including ""Quetzalcoatlus"" and ""Hatzegopteryx"". Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. The olecranon fossa is a deep triangular depression on the posterior side of the humerus, superior to the trochlea, in which the summit of the olecranon is received during extension of the forearm. An epicondyle is a rounded eminence on a bone that lies upon a condyle (""epi-"", ""upon"" + ""condyle"", from a root meaning ""knuckle"" or ""rounded articular area""). There are various epicondyles in the human skeleton, each named by its anatomic site. They include the following: The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The shoulder joint also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid cavity. The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint. A finger is a limb of the human body and a type of digit, an organ of manipulation and found in the hands of humans and other primates.
Normally humans have five digits, the bones of which are termed phalanges, on each hand, although some people have more or fewer than five due to congenital disorders such as polydactyly or oligodactyly, or accidental or medical amputations. The first digit is the thumb, followed by index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger or pinky. According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not. In primates, including humans, the elbow joint is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the hand to be moved towards and away from the body. The superior radioulnar joint shares joint capsule with the elbow joint but plays no functional role at the elbow. The elbow region includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon (the bony prominence at the very tip of the elbow), the elbow pit, and the lateral and medial epicondyles. The name for the elbow in Latin is ""cubitus"", and so the word cubital is used in some elbow-related terms, as in ""cubital nodes"" for example. Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals.
The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.  Hatzegopteryx ( `` Haeg basin wing '' ) is a genus of azhdarchid pterosaur , known from incomplete remains found in Hunedoara County , Transylvania , Romania . The skull fragments , left humerus , and other fossilized remains indicate it was among the largest pterosaurs . The skeleton of Hatzegopteryx has been considered identical to the known remains of Quetzalcoatlus northropi . Q. northropi has not yet been properly described , and if it is not a nomen dubium , Hatzegopteryx is possibly its junior synonym . Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just ""binomial""), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ""Homo"" and within this genus to the species ""Homo sapiens"". The ""formal"" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work ""Species Plantarum"" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book ""Pinax theatri botanici"" (English, ""Illustrated exposition of plants"") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a ""transitional"" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe. The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. The long bones are those that are longer than they are wide. They are one of five types of bones: long, short, flat, irregular and sesamoid. Long bones, especially the femur and tibia, are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility. They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis, with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone. The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage (""articular cartilage""). The longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate. Bone growth in length is stimulated by the production of growth hormone (GH), a secretion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (""tri"" meaning ""three"") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the ""Trias""."

Leonard, based on the novel ""Ex-Wife"" by Ursula Parrott. The film stars Norma Shearer as the leading lady, with Lionel Barrymore, Clark Gable, and Leslie Howard in supporting roles. The story revolves around an alcoholic defense attorney, played by Lionel Barrymore, who must defend his daughter's ex-boyfriend on a murder charge. The film became famous for Barrymore's monologue, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

The film also features Clark Gable in his first screen appearance alongside Shearer, which would later lead to his rise as a leading man in Hollywood. The Barrymore family, known for their acting prowess, also makes an appearance in the film.

The film's success led to the creation of the Dr. Kildare series, with Norma Shearer reprising her role in the 1937 film ""Internes Can't Take Money."" The character of Dr. Kildare was later adapted into a radio series, a television series, and a comic book and comic strip.

The film's setting in Hollywood, the home of the U.S. film industry, further emphasizes the importance of the film industry in shaping American culture and society. The film industry has been a significant part of Los Angeles' identity, with Hollywood being synonymous with the industry and its people.

In conclusion, ""The Divorcee"" is a significant film in American cinema history, not only for its storyline and performances but also for its impact on the film industry and Hollywood's cultural significance. The film's success led to the creation of the Dr. Kildare series, which further solidified the film industry's influence on American society. ","Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities. Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. Great Northern Railway Buildings is a set of five complexes of buildings in Glacier National Park in Montana. They were built by the Great Northern Railway. Going-to-the-Sun Road is a scenic mountain road in the Rocky Mountains of the western United States, in Glacier National Park in Montana. The Sun Road, as it is sometimes abbreviated in National Park Service documents, is the only road that traverses the park crossing the Continental Divide through Logan Pass at an elevation of , which is the highest point on the road. Construction began in 1921 and was completed in 1932 with formal dedication in the following summer on July 15, 1933. The road is the first to have been registered in all of the following categories: National Historic Place, National Historic Landmark and Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The length of the road is approximately and spans the width of the park between the east and west entrance stations. The National Historic Landmark Nomination records a slightly shorter distance of 48.7 miles which is measured from the first main intersection just outside the park's west entrance to Divide Creek in St. Mary on the east side of the park. Saskatchewan (or ) is a prairie and boreal province in west-central Canada, the only province without natural borders. It has an area of , nearly 10 percent of which is fresh water, composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes. Logan Pass (elevation ) is located along the Continental Divide in Glacier National Park, in the U.S. state of Montana. It is the highest point on the Going-to-the-Sun Road. Sperry Chalet is located about seven miles east of Lake McDonald in Glacier National Park in the U.S. state of Montana . The chalet was opened in 1914 by the Great Northern Railway and is a National Historic Landmark contributing property , being one of five structures in the Great Northern Railway Buildings National Historic Landmark . Along with Granite Park Chalet , Sperry Chalet is one of the two remaining backcountry chalets in Glacier National Park , both operated by Belton Chalets , Inc. The chalet is reached only by trail , via hiking or horseback . One of the two trails leading to the chalet are the Sperry Trail , which starts at the Lake McDonald Lodge parking lot and stretches 6.7 miles to the chalet , climbing 3200 feet in the process . The trail passes along the base of Mount Brown and over the west ridge of Mount Edwards , with views of U-shaped valleys along the way . A side trip to Sperry Glacier is also possible , being a 4 mile hike ( 8 miles round trip ) . The other means of accessing the chalet is via the Gunsight Trail , which is a 12.1 mile hike from the Jackson Glacier Overlook on Going - to - the - Sun Road . This hike averages 9 hours , so it is important to plan ahead . The chalet , nestled in a glacial cirque , consists of two buildings from the Great Northern era : a two story hotel building and a kitchen / dining room building . A restroom facility has been added , but is not part of the historic landmark designation . The dormitory building , completed in 1913 , is built with random rubble masonry , providing a feel of architectural ruggedness , and is topped with a large gable roof that has two dormers on either side . The kitchen building , completed in 1912 , is also made of random rubble masonry , but uses smaller stones and appears less striking in its design . The kitchen building is topped with a lower gable roof . Unlike Granite Park Chalet , Sperry Chalet provides traditional meal service : dinner , breakfast , and either a trail lunch or an ala carte lunch in the dining room . The guest rooms are private , but in line with the backcountry experience , there is no electricity or heat . There is running water at the bathroom facility . Lake McDonald is the largest lake in Glacier National Park. It is located at in Flathead County in the U.S. state of Montana. Lake McDonald is approximately 10 miles (16 km) long, and over a mile (1.6 km) wide and 472 feet (130 m) deep, filling a valley formed by a combination of erosion and glacial activity. Lake McDonald lies at an elevation of 3,153 feet (960 m) and is on the west side of the Continental Divide. The Going-to-the-Sun Road parallels the lake along its southern shoreline. The surface area of the lake is 6,823 acres (27.6 km). A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. Of over 85,000 places listed on the country's National Register of Historic Places, only some 2,500 are recognized as National Historic Landmarks. A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: ""a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen"". Idaho is a state in the northwestern region of the United States. It borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia. With a population of around 1.7 million people and an area of , Idaho is the 14th largest and 39th most populous of the 50 states. The state's capital and largest city is Boise. Badlands are a type of dry terrain where softer sedimentary rocks and clay-rich soils have been extensively eroded by wind and water. They are characterized by steep slopes, minimal vegetation, lack of a substantial regolith, and high drainage density. They can resemble malpaís, a terrain of volcanic rock. Canyons, ravines, gullies, buttes, mesas, hoodoos and other such geological forms are common in badlands. They are often difficult to navigate by foot. Badlands often have a spectacular color display that alternates from dark black/blue coal stria to bright clays to red scoria. The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property. The Garden Wall is a steep alpine area within Glacier National Park well known during the summer months to be heavily covered in dozens of species of flowering plants and shrubs. Located along the west side of the Continental divide and extending northward from Logan Pass, the Garden Wall can be traversed via the popular Highline Trail and for a distance of over to the Granite Park Chalet. The Going-to-the-Sun Road also passes through portions of the Garden Wall northwest of Logan Pass. The Weeping Wall is a short stretch of the Going-to-the-Sun Road where water cascades over the Garden Wall to the roadway below. The Garden Wall is an arête or rock spine that separates the Many Glacier region of the park from Lake McDonald valley. North Dakota (locally ) is the 39th state of the United States, having been admitted to the union on November 2, 1889. A continental divide is a drainage divide on a continent such that the drainage basin on one side of the divide feeds into one ocean or sea, and the basin on the other side either feeds into a different ocean or sea, or else is endorheic, not connected to the open sea. British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. 
British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation. Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905. The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015. A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia.
Lands typically referred to as ""prairie"" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota. The Central Valley of California is also a prairie. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Granite Park Chalet is located in the heart of Glacier National Park in the U.S. state of Montana at an elevation of 6,693 feet above sea level. The chalet was built in 1914 by the Great Northern Railway and is a National Historic Landmark contributing property, being one of five structures in the 
Great Northern Railway Buildings district. From Logan Pass along the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the chalet is a moderate hike along the famed Crown of the Continent Highline Trail, usually referred to simply as the Highline Trail. Much of the trail passes through the scenic Garden Wall section of the park, immediately west and parallel to the Continental Divide. The chalet is also accessible via the Loop Trail (elevation gain) and the Swiftcurrent Trail (elevation gain). The trails are for hikers and horseback riders only; no vehicle access is provided. Granite Park Chalet is a limited services facility and those that spend the night make use of the full service kitchen to cook their own meals. Montana is a state in the Western region of the United States. The state's name is derived from the Spanish word (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including ""Big Sky Country"" and ""The Treasure State"", and slogans that include ""Land of the Shining Mountains"" and more recently ""The Last Best Place"". Montana has a border with three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, the only state to do so. It also borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and Idaho to the west and southwest. Montana is ranked 4th in size, but 44th in population and 48th in population density of the 50 United States. The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges. Smaller island ranges are found throughout the state. In total, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern half of Montana is characterized by western prairie terrain and badlands."

It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called ""peace"". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913  January 29, 1964) was an American actor and film and television producer. Ladd found success in film the 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in Westerns such as ""Shane"" (1953) and film noirs where he was often paired with Veronica Lake, such as ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942), ""The Glass Key"" (1942) and ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946). Other notable credits include ""Two Years Before the Mast"" (1946), ""Whispering Smith"" (1949) and ""The Great Gatsby"" (1949). His popularity diminished in the late 1950s, though he continued to appear in popular films until his accidental death due to a lethal combination of alcohol, a barbiturate, and two tranquilizers. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the United States Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the ""Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff"" (""CJCS""), ""Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff"" (""VCJCS""), and the Military Service Chiefs from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, all appointed by the President following Senate confirmation. Each of the individual Military Service Chiefs, outside of their Joint Chiefs of Staff obligations, works directly for the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, i.e., Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force. The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.
From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism. The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the ""Evil Dead"" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is ""Trigger Mortis"" by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. Whispering Smith (1948) is a Western film starring Alan Ladd as a railroad detective assigned to stop a gang of train robbers. The supporting cast includes Robert Preston and Brenda Marshall. War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film. Two Years Before the Mast is a memoir by the American author Richard Henry Dana Jr., published in 1840, having been written after a two-year sea voyage from Boston to California on a merchant ship starting in 1834. A film adaptation under the same name was released in 1946. Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see ""literary"" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. O.S.S. is a 1946 war film starring Alan Ladd and Geraldine Fitzgerald about the Office of Strategic Services , directed by Irving Pichel , who would soon be blacklisted and written by Richard Maibaum , a World War Two vet who would later write 12 of the first 15 James Bond films .

World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of ""total war"", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression. Veronica Lake (born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman; November 14, 1922  July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress. Lake won both popular and critical acclaim, most notably for her role in ""Sullivan's Travels"" and for her femme fatale roles in film noirs with Alan Ladd, during the 1940s. She was also well known for her peek-a-boo hairstyle. Lake's career had begun to decline by the late 1940s, in part due to her alcoholism. She made only one film in the 1950s but appeared in several guest-starring roles on television. She returned to the screen in 1966 with a role in the film ""Footsteps In the Snow"", but the role failed to revitalize her career."

The Battle of Maastricht was a key engagement during the German Campaign on the Western Front. The objective was to capture the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael, a neutralized fortress that had been taken by glider-borne German troops in May 1940. The fort's capture was crucial for the Germans to advance into Belgium and split the Allied forces.

Fort Eben-Emael, located between Liège and Maastricht on the Belgian-Dutch border, was constructed between 1931 and 1935 and was considered impregnable at the time. The successful neutralization of the fort by the Germans paved the way for their ground forces to enter Belgium without facing fire from the fort. The fort has since been preserved and is open for public visitation.

In summary, the United States' use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Battle of Maastricht, and the capture of Fort Eben-Emael were significant events during World War II. The war resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in human history. The Holocaust, a genocide carried out by Nazi Germany, claimed the lives of six million Jews and five million non-Jewish victims.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

","Branigan is the debut album by American singer Laura Branigan, recorded in 1981 and released in March 1982 on Atlantic Records.  Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian; May 20, 1946) is an American singer and actress. Commonly referred to as the Goddess of Pop, she is described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. She is known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances during her five-decade-long career. Laura Ann Branigan (July 3, 1957  August 26, 2004) was an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She had hits in the 1980s with the platinum-certified ""Gloria,"" ""Self Control,"" ""Solitaire,"" and the No. 1 Adult Contemporary (AC) hit ""How Am I Supposed to Live Without You"" as well as several other U.S. top-40 songs. Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. `` I Found Someone '' is the name of a chart single originally written and composed for Laura Branigan by Michael Bolton and Touch keyboardist Mark Mangold . The song was a bigger hit for Cher in 1987 , reaching the Top 10 . Michael Bolotin (born February 26, 1953), known professionally as Michael Bolton, is an American singer and songwriter. Bolton originally performed in the hard rock and heavy metal genres from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, both on his early solo albums and those he recorded as the frontman of the band Blackjack. He became better known for his series of pop rock ballads, recorded after a stylistic change in the late 1980s. ""How Am I Supposed to Live Without You"" is a song written in 1983 by Doug James and Michael Bolton. The ballad has been recorded by many artists around the world, in several languages, becoming something of a modern pop standard. Instrumental versions of the song have been recorded featuring variously the piano, guitar, saxophone, pan flute, steel drum, and music box. A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French ""chanson balladée"" or ""ballade"", which were originally ""danced songs"". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables."
299,Which airline alliance does Lufthansa Regional belong to?,star alliance,"['oneworld', 'star alliance']"," A mansard roof, also known as a French or curb roof, is a distinctive four-sided roof style with two slopes on each side. The lower slope is steeper and often features dormer windows, while the upper slope is shallower. This design allows for additional living space (garret) and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of stories. The term ""gambrel"" refers to a similar roof style with two slopes on each side, but with a shallower upper slope.

Dougong is a unique structural element in traditional Chinese architecture, consisting of interlocking wooden brackets. It is one of the most important elements in Chinese architecture, providing stability and support to the roof structure.

The Latin language, originating from the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages, is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. The Latin alphabet is widely used in various languages and has influenced many modern alphabets.

In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves. Dutch Colonial is a style of domestic architecture characterized by gambrel roofs with curved eaves along the length of the house. Modern versions of this style are referred to as Dutch Colonial Revival, a subtype of the Colonial Revival style.

Eaves are the edges of the roof that overhang the face of a wall and project beyond the side of a building. They serve to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style. The dougong bracket systems in Chinese architecture are an example of such decorative eaves. ","Star Alliance is one of the world's largest global airline alliances.

300,Which noble family did Louis of Lower Lorraine belong to?,carolingian dynasty,"['carolingian dynasty', 'house of capet', 'house of france', 'robertians']"," The School of Salamanca, a group of Spanish and Portuguese theologians, emerged in the 16th century to address new intellectual challenges brought about by humanism, the Protestant Reformation, and the geographical discoveries of the time. The group, based at the University of Salamanca, sought to reconcile these challenges with traditional Catholic teachings.

One of the School's most influential members was Francisco de Vitoria, a Spanish Renaissance philosopher and jurist. Vitoria is considered the founder of the School of Salamanca and a key figure in the development of international law. His work focused on the rights of individuals and the concept of just war. Vitoria's ideas on freedom of commerce and the seas were groundbreaking and laid the foundation for modern international law.

The School of Salamanca's ideas were shaped by the political and social context of Spain during the Renaissance. Spain was a powerful and influential European nation, with a strong Catholic identity. The School's members sought to defend the Catholic Church's teachings while also promoting human dignity and individual rights.

The School of Salamanca's ideas had a significant impact on the development of international law and human rights. Their work laid the groundwork for the modern concepts of sovereignty, the rule of law, and the rights of individuals. The School's ideas continue to influence contemporary debates on international law and human rights.

In conclusion, the School of Salamanca was a group of Spanish and Portuguese theologians who sought to address the intellectual challenges of the 16th century. Their work, particularly that of Francisco de Vitoria, laid the foundation for modern international law and human rights. The School's ideas were shaped by the political and social context of Spain during the Renaissance and continue to influence contemporary debates on these issues. ","Hugh Capet (c. 941  24 October 996) was the first King of the Franks of the House of Capet from his election in 987 until his death. He succeeded the last Carolingian king, Louis V. Louis of Lower Lorraine ( c. 980 -- after 1012 ) was the second of Charles of Lorraine 's three sons and the eldest by his second marriage to Adelaide , the daughter of a low - ranking vassal of Hugh Capet . Unlike his elder brother Otto , who inherited their father 's duchy of Lower Lorraine , Louis went with his father to France , where Charles fought for the French throne . They both were imprisoned , through the perfidy of Adalberon , Bishop of Laon , by Hugh at Orléans in 991 , when Louis was still a child . His father died in prison in or by 993 , but Louis was released . It was asserted by Ferdinand Lot that Louis 's life after 995 or 1000 was completely unknown , but more recent research has shed some light upon it . It was William IV of Aquitaine who sheltered Louis afterwards , from 1005 until 1012 . He opened the Palace of Poitiers to him and treated him as royalty , regarding him as the true heir to the French throne . Louis even subscribed a charter of William 's as Lodoici filii Karoli regis . Young Louis drifted , eventually to be utilised by Robert II , Archbishop of Rouen , who was plotting against the Capetians . Louis was imprisoned again , permanently , this time at Sens , where he died . The House of Capet or the Direct Capetians, also called the House of France (""la maison de France""), or simply the Capets, ruled the Kingdom of France from 987 to 1328. It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty  itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians. Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name ""Capetian"" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called ""the third race of kings"", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as ""Hugh Capet"". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. The Kingdom of Germany or German Kingdom (""Teutonic Kingdom"") developed out of the eastern half of the former Carolingian Empire. Like Anglo-Saxon England and medieval France, it began as ""a conglomerate, an assemblage of a number of once separate and independent... ""gentes"" [peoples] and ""regna"" [kingdoms]."" East Francia (""Ostfrankenreich"") was formed by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, and was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty until 911, after which the kingship was elective. The initial electors were the rulers of the stem duchies, who generally chose one of their own. After 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, the kingdom formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included Italy (after 951), Bohemia (after 1004) and Burgundy (after 1032). A stem duchy (from ""stamm"", meaning ""tribe"", in reference to the Germanic tribes of the Franks, Saxons, Bavarians and Swabians) was a constituent duchy of the kingdom of Germany at the time of the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty (the death of Louis the Child in 911) and the transitional period leading to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire later in the 10th century. The Carolingians had dissolved the original tribal duchies of the Frankish Empire in the 8th century. As the Carolingian Empire declined in the late 9th century, the old tribal areas assumed new identities as the subdivisions of the realm. These are the five stem duchies (sometimes also called ""younger stem duchies"" in reference to the pre-Carolingian tribal duchies):
Bavaria, Franconia, Lotharingia, Saxony and Swabia (Alemannia). 
The stem duchies were retained as the major divisions of Germany under the Salian dynasty, but they became increasingly obsolete during the early high medieval period under the Hohenstaufen, and they were finally abolished in 1180 by Frederick Barbarossa in favour of more numerous territorial duchies. The Duchy of Lower Lorraine or Lower Lotharingia (also referred to sometimes as ""Lothier"" or ""Lottier"" in titles), established in 959 was a stem duchy of the medieval Kingdom of Germany, which encompassed almost all of the modern-day Netherlands (including Friesland), mid and eastern Belgium, Luxemburg, the northern part of the German Rhineland province and the eastern parts of France's Nord Pas De Calais region."

","Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word ""alternative"" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, ""alternative"" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). A Certain Ratio are an English post-punk band formed in 1977 in Wythenshawe, Manchester. While originally part of the punk rock movement, they soon added funk and dance elements to their sound. Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise.

Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term ""graphic design"" is used synonymously.

Lyricist Jerome ""Jerry"" Leiber (April 25, 1933  August 22, 2011) and composer Mike Stoller (born March 13, 1933) were American songwriting and record producing partners. They found initial successes as the writers of such crossover hit songs as ""Hound Dog"" (1952) and ""Kansas City"" (1952). Later in the 1950s, particularly through their work with The Coasters, they created a string of ground-breaking hitsincluding ""Young Blood"" (1957), ""Searchin'"" (1957), and ""Yakety Yak"" (1958)that used the humorous vernacular of teenagers sung in a style that was openly theatrical rather than personal. They were the first to surround black music with elaborate production values, enhancing its emotional power with The Drifters in ""There Goes My Baby"" (1958), which influenced Phil Spector, who studied their productions while playing guitar on their sessions. Britannia was the Greek and Roman term for the geographical region of Great Britain or Great Britain and Ireland which was inhabited by the Britons and is the name given to the female personification of the island. It is a term still used to refer to the island today. The name is Latin, and derives from the Greek form ""Prettanike"" or ""Brettaniai"", which originally designated a collection of islands with individual names, including ""Albion"" or Great Britain; however, by the 1st century BC, ""Britannia"" came to be used for Great Britain specifically. The Brit Awards (sometimes stylised as the BRIT Awards; often simply called the Brits) are the British Phonographic Industry's annual pop music awards.

303,What was the instrument played by Mani Neumeier?,drum kit,"['bass', 'double bass', 'drum kit', 'electric guitar', 'guitar', 'hammond organ', 'organ', 'piano', 'saxophone']"," The infantry tank was a concept developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. These tanks were designed to support infantry soldiers in an attack by providing heavy armor to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armor came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving infantry.

One example of an infantry tank was the Bishop, a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. It was armed with the 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an 87.6 mm (3.45 in) 11.5 kg (25 lb) HE shell or an armor-piercing shell. However, the Bishop was a rushed attempt to create a self-propelled gun and had numerous problems. It was produced in limited numbers and soon replaced by better designs.

Another example of an infantry tank was the Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be both strong and reliable. Over 8,000 of the type were produced in eleven marks, plus various specialized variants, accounting for approximately a quarter of wartime British tank production. The many variants included riveted and welded construction, petrol and diesel engines, and a progressive increase in armament. The Valentine was supplied in large numbers to the USSR and built under license in Canada.

In summary, infantry tanks were developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II to support infantry soldiers in an attack. These tanks were heavily armored to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The Valentine tank was a successful example of an infantry tank, with over 8,000 units produced in eleven marks and various specialized variants. However, the Bishop self-propelled artillery vehicle was a rushed attempt that had numerous problems and was soon replaced by better designs. ","Hard bop is a subgenre of jazz that is an extension of bebop (or ""bop"") music. Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz which incorporated influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and blues, especially in saxophone and piano playing. Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. Krautrock (sometimes called ""kosmische Musik"") is a broad genre of experimental rock that developed in Germany in the late 1960s. The term ""krautrock"" was originated by English-speaking music journalists as a humorous name for a diverse range of German bands whose music drew from sources such as psychedelic rock, avant-garde electronic music, funk, minimalism, jazz improvisation, and world music styles. Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Important acts of the scene include Can, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Faust. Ash Ra Tempel was a German krautrock group active from 1970 to 1976. It was Manuel Göttsching's first prominent musical output. Ash Ra Tempel featured revolving members, with only Göttsching remaining constant. Eventually, Göttsching retired the use of the Ash Ra Tempel name after he became the sole remaining member. His first solo album ""Inventions for Electric Guitar"" was the last album to bear the Ash Ra Tempel name. It was subtitled ""Ash Ra Tempel VI"" functioning as the sixth and final album. Göttsching later began using the name Ashra for his solo output as an homage to his former group. Ashra eventually evolved into a full band and continued along with Göttsching until 1998. Mani Neumeier ( Manfred Neumeier , born December 31 , 1940 in Munich ) is a German rock musician , free jazz - drummer , artist , and frontman ( singer and drummer ) of the German Krautrock - band Guru Guru . Probably best known for his work with Guru Guru , Neumeier collaborated with numerous bands and artists , such as Dieter Möbius , Damo Suzuki , Harmonia , Hans - Karsten Raecke , Irène Schweizer , Peter Brötzmann , Sonny Sharrock , Uchihashi Kazuhisa , Jojo Hiroshige , Kawabata Makoto , Yoshida Tatsuya , and Luigi Archetti . Neumeier has lived in Germany and Japan . The wax museum of Tokyo has a wax figure of him . He has also regularly collaborated with Japanese jam and noise bands Acid Mothers Temple and Hijokaidan . Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer. Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or ""worried notes""), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. Jazz improvisation, which is the making up of new melodic solo lines or accompaniment parts, is a key aspect of jazz. Improvisation is composing on the spot, in which a singer or instrumentalist invents solo melodies and lines over top of a chord progression played by rhythm section instruments (piano, electric guitar, double bass, etc.) and also accompanied by drum kit. While blues, rock and other genres also use improvisation, the improvisation in these non-jazz genres typically is done over relatively simple chord progressions which often stay in one key (or closely related keys using the circle of fifths, such as a song in C Major modulating to G Major).  Guru Guru is a German krautrock band formed in 1968 as ""The Guru Guru Groove"" by Mani Neumeier (drums), Uli Trepte (bass) and Eddy Naegeli (guitar) later replaced by American Jim Kennedy (guitar). In time for their debut in 1970, Ax Genrich had replaced Kennedy to solidify the classic Guru Guru line up."

In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. Human geography is the branch of the social sciences that deals with the study of people and their communities,
cultures, economies and interaction with the environment by noticing their relations with and across space and place. As an intellectual discipline, geography is divided into the sub-fields of physical geography and human geography, the latter concentrating upon the study of human activities, by the application of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Claudius Ptolemy (""Klaúdios Ptolemaîos"", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. Modern warfare is warfare using the concepts, methods, and military technology that have come into use during and after World War II. The concepts and methods have assumed more complex forms of the 19th- and early-20th-century antecedents, largely due to the widespread use of highly advanced information technology, and combatants must modernize constantly to preserve their battle worthiness.
Although total war was thought to be the form of international conflicts from the experience of the French Revolutionary Wars to World War II, the term no longer describes warfare in which a belligerent use all of its resources to destroy the enemy's organized ability to engage in war. The practice of total war which had been in use for over a century, as a form of war policy, has been changed dramatically with greater awareness of tactical, operational, and strategic battle information. Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. Postcolonialism or postcolonial studies is an academic discipline that analyzes, explains, and responds to the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Postcolonialism speaks about the human consequences of external control and economic exploitation of native people and their lands. Drawing from postmodern schools of thought, postcolonial studies analyse the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by examining the functional relations of social and political power that sustain colonialism and neocolonialismthe imperial regime's depictions (social, political, cultural) of the colonizer and of the colonized. Jane Margaret Jacobs ( born May 2 , 1958 ) is an Australian academic , currently serving as Professor of Social Sciences at Yale - NUS College and formerly as Professor of Cultural Geography , in the School of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh . She was previously at the University of Melbourne . Jacobs ' work has focused on Postcolonialism ; indigenous rights and identity ; race and racism ; cultural politics of urban space ; high - rise housing and modernity ; and the politics of cultural heritage . Jacobs has published several books , a large number of book chapters and articles in peer - reviewed international scholarly journals . Racism is discrimination and prejudice towards people based on their race or ethnicity. Today, the use of the term ""racism"" does not easily fall under a single definition. The University of Melbourne (informally Melbourne University) is a public research university located in Melbourne, Australia. Founded in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest university and the oldest in Victoria. Times Higher Education ranks Melbourne as 33rd in the world, while the Academic Ranking of World Universities places Melbourne 40th in the world (both first in Australia).  Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 local government council areas. Located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore, it is Scotland's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The 2014 official population estimates are 464,990 for the city of Edinburgh, 492,680 for the local authority area, and 1,339,380 for the city region as of 2014 (Edinburgh lies at the heart of the proposed Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region). Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland. The city is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and home to national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. It is the largest financial centre in the UK after London. Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. Biodiversity, a contraction of ""biological diversity,"" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future. Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world. In human social affairs, discrimination is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which the person or thing is perceived to belong rather than on individual merit. This includes treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, ""in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated"". It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making. Neocolonialism, neo-colonialism or neo-imperialism is the practice of using capitalism, globalization and cultural imperialism to influence a developing country in lieu of direct military control (imperialism) or indirect political control (hegemony). Neo-colonialism is discussed in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre (""Colonialism and Neo-colonialism"", 1964) and Noam Chomsky (""The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism"", 1979). Cultural geography is a sub-field within human geography. Though the first traces of the study of different nations and cultures on Earth can be dated back to ancient geographers such as Ptolemy or Strabo, cultural geography as academic study firstly emerged as an alternative to the environmental determinist theories of the early Twentieth century, which had believed that people and societies are controlled by the environment in which they develop. Rather than studying pre-determined regions based upon environmental classifications, cultural geography became interested in cultural landscapes. This was led by Carl O. Sauer (called the father of cultural geography), at the University of California, Berkeley. As a result, cultural geography was long dominated by American writers. Professor (commonly abbreviated as ""prof."") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, ""professor"" derives from Latin as a ""person who professes"" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. The University of Edinburgh (abbreviated as Edin. in post-nominals), founded in 1582, is the sixth oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's ancient universities. The university is deeply embedded in the fabric of the city of Edinburgh, with many of the buildings in the historic Old Town belonging to the university. Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. Modernity is a term of art used in the humanities and social sciences to designate both a historical period (the modern era), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in post-medieval Europe and have developed since, in various ways and at various times, around the world. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics . A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become important to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, or as an example of historic architecture. The term 'monument' is often applied to buildings or structures that are considered examples of important architectural and/or cultural heritage. Prejudice is prejudgement or forming an opinion before becoming aware of the relevant facts of a case. The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, judgments toward people or a person because of their gender, beliefs, values, social class, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race/ethnicity, language, nationality, beauty, occupation, education, criminality, sport team affiliation or other personal characteristics. In this case, it refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on their perceived group membership. Strabo (""Strabn""; 64 or 63 BC) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Carl Ortwin Sauer (December 24, 1889  July 18, 1975) was an American geographer. Sauer was a professor of geography at the University of California at Berkeley from 1923 until becoming professor emeritus in 1957. He has been called ""the dean of American historical geography"" and he was instrumental in the early development of the geography graduate school at Berkeley. One of his best known works was ""Agricultural Origins and Dispersals"" (1952). In 1927, Carl Sauer wrote the article ""Recent Developments in Cultural Geography,"" which considered how cultural landscapes are made up of ""the forms superimposed on the physical landscape."" Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is ""that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, ""Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common."" Cultural heritage is the legacy of physical science artifacts and intangible attributes of a group or society that are inherited from past generations, maintained in the present and bestowed for the benefit of future generations. Cultural heritage includes tangible culture (such as buildings, monuments, landscapes, books, works of art, and artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language, and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant landscapes, and biodiversity). A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word ""tradition"" itself derives from the Latin ""tradere"" or ""traderer"" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.  Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term ""costume"" is regularly linked to the term ""fashion"", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while ""fashion"" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous. Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as Shanghai Ranking, is an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy. The league table was originally compiled and issued by Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2003, the first global ranking with multifarious indicators, after which a board of international advisories was established to provide suggestions. The publication currently includes world's overall and subject league tables, alongside independent regional ""Greater China Ranking"" and ""Macedonian HEIs Ranking"". ARWU is regarded as one of the three most influential and widely observed university measures, alongside ""QS World University Rankings"" and ""Times Higher Education World University Rankings"". 
It is praised for its objective methodology but draws some condemnation for narrowly focusing on raw research power, undermining humanities and quality of instruction. Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a ""social science"". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.

The Itakura clan identified its origins in Mikawa province and were considered the elder branch of the clan.

In recognition of his service, Shigemune was assigned as the daimyo of Sekiyado Domain in 1622. His court title was Suo no Kami. The Itakura clan was one of the most successful and powerful lineages of the Japanese Minamoto clan, which was descended from Emperor Seiwa.

Anarcho-punk (or anarchist punk) is punk rock that promotes anarchism. The term ""anarcho-punk"" is sometimes applied exclusively to bands that were part of the original anarcho-punk movement in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some use the term more broadly to refer to any punk or rock music with anarchist lyrical content, including crust punk, d-beat, folk punk, hardcore punk, garage punk or ska punk. London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it ""Londinium"". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, ""London"" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

Punk rock (or simply ""punk"") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as ""proto-punk"" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. Flux of Pink Indians were an English anarcho-punk/post punk band, that originated from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England. Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word ""alternative"" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, ""alternative"" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). One Little Indian Records is a London-based independent record label that rose from the ashes of punk rock record company Spiderleg Records. It was set up in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett. Spiderleg Records was an independent record label founded by UK anarcho-punk band Flux of Pink Indians in 1981."

This family used to include genera like Atrax, which are now classified under the Hexathelidae family. Atrax, specifically the Sydney funnel-web spider (""Atrax robustus""), is a venomous spider found in eastern Australia. Its bite can cause serious injury or death in humans if left untreated. However, modern first aid techniques and antivenom have prevented fatalities.

The Theraphosidae family, commonly known as tarantulas, comprises around 900 species of large and often hairy arachnids. While some species can cause severe allergic reactions, they are not generally dangerous to humans. The Atracinae subfamily, also known as Australian funnel-web spiders, consists of three genera: Atrax, Hadronyche, and Illawarra, with 35 species. Six of these species produce venom that can cause severe injuries to humans.

The Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is the only family in the superfamily Hexatheloidea. Despite their impressive size, these spiders are shy and there are no records of them biting humans. The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathelena hochstetteri) is a large spider native to New Zealand, and it is not known to bite humans.

In summary, the Dipluridae family includes venomous spiders like the Sydney funnel-web spider, which can cause serious harm to humans if bitten. However, modern first aid techniques and antivenom have made fatalities rare. The Theraphosidae family, which includes tarantulas, is not generally dangerous to humans, and the Hexathelidae family, which includes the Sydney funnel-web spider, is not known to bite humans. ","Luis Philip Senarens ( 1863 -- 1939 ) was an American dime novel writer specializing in science fiction , once called `` the American Jules Verne '' .

Senarens introduced Frank Reade , Jr. as the new main character , and added elements such as electricity . The stories were very successful , and by the 1890s Senarens was asked by publisher Frank Tousey to write a similar series featuring Jack Wright , the `` Boy Inventor '' . Later in the decade , Tousey created the Frank Reade Library , a periodical devoted to `` invention '' stories , largely ( or wholly ) composed by Senarens using the pseudonym Noname . Mike Ashley calls him `` the first prolific writer of science fiction '' . He would eventually write more than 300 dime novels . In 1917 Senarens became the editor of the Tousey detective story periodical , Mystery Magazine . Brooklyn is the most populous borough of New York City, with a Census-estimated 2,636,735 residents in 2015. It borders the borough of Queens at the southwestern end of Long Island. Since 1896, Brooklyn has had the same boundaries as Kings County, the most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, after the county of New York (which is coextensive with the borough of Manhattan). Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. A potboiler or pot-boiler is a novel, play, opera, film, or other creative work of dubious literary or artistic merit, whose main purpose was to pay for the creator's daily expensesthus the imagery of ""boil the pot"", which means ""to provide one's livelihood"". Authors who create potboiler novels or screenplays are sometimes called hack writers or hacks. Novels deemed to be potboilers may also be called pulp fiction, and potboiler films may be called ""popcorn movies."" A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, ""writer"" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an ""extraterrestrial"" or ""alien""), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. Oral tradition, or oral lore, is a form of human communication wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another. The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledge across generations without a writing system, or in parallel to a writing system. Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as Sushruta Samhita, hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next. Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a ""literature of ideas."" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. A playwright, also known as a dramatist, is a person who writes plays. Innovation can be defined simply as a ""new idea, device, or method"". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term ""innovation"" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that ""breaks into"" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. The supernatural (Medieval Latin: ""superntrlis"": ""supra"" ""above"" + ""naturalis"" ""natural"", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel ""The Time Machine"", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. Jules Gabriel Verne ( 8 February 1828  24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction. A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s ""Islands of Space"" in ""Astounding Science Fiction"". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the ""hard"" (natural) and ""soft"" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term ""New York minute"". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. The dime novel is a form of late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. popular fiction issued in series of inexpensive paperbound editions. The term ""dime novel"" has been used as a catchall term for several different but related forms, referring to dime novels, story papers, five- and ten-cent weeklies, ""thick book"" reprints, and sometimes early pulp magazines. The term was used as a title as late as 1940, in the short-lived pulp magazine ""Western Dime Novels"". Dime novels are the antecedent of today's mass-market paperbacks, comic books, television shows and movies based on dime-novel genres. In the modern age, the term ""dime novel"" has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid potboilers, usually as a pejorative to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work. A story paper is a periodical publication similar to a literary magazine, but featuring illustrations and text stories, and aimed towards children and teenagers. Also known in Britain as 'Boys' Weeklies', story papers were phenomenally popular before the outbreak of the Second World War. Technology (""science of craft"", from Greek , ""techne"", ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and , ""-logia"") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant ""speculative literature""."

Karlsson-on-the-Roof (Swedish: ""Karlsson på taket"") is a character who figures in a series of children's books by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. A cartoon adaptation of the series became popular in the Soviet Union when it was released in the 1970s. These adaptations are still celebrated to this day as an integral part of the Russian cartoon industry. Karlsson, together with Cheburashka and other such characters, are recognized as a national icon.

A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as ""The Adventures of Tintin"". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning ("""") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.

Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house.
Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the ""floor"" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election."

Choreography, the art of designing sequences of movements, is a significant aspect of culture, particularly in the performing arts. It involves creating purposeful sequences of human movement with aesthetic and symbolic value, which are acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture.

Choreography is used in various fields, including musical theater, cheerleading, cinematography, gymnastics, fashion shows, ice skating, marching band, show choir, theatre, synchronized swimming, cardistry, video game production, and animated art. Solo dancers, who are usually the best dancers in a group or dance school, perform at the edges of the street in Comparsas, carrying large lantern-like artifacts on poles.

Performance art, a form of art presented to an audience within a fine art context, can be scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated. It can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting, and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work. A performance in the performing arts generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience, often followed by applause. ","The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.  An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.

The Syrtis Major quadrangle is also referred to as MC-13 (Mars Chart-13). A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms ""terrestrial planet"" and ""telluric planet"" are derived from Latin words for Earth (""Terra"" and ""Tellus""), as these planets are, in terms of composition, ""Earth-like"". Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=""doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012""></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. Syrtis Major Planum is a ""dark spot"" (an albedo feature) located in the boundary between the northern lowlands and southern highlands of Mars just west of the impact basin Isidis in the Syrtis Major quadrangle. It was discovered, on the basis of data from Mars Global Surveyor, to be a low-relief shield volcano, but was formerly believed to be a plain, and was then known as Syrtis Major Planitia. The dark color comes from the basaltic volcanic rock of the region and the relative lack of dust. Nilo Syrtis ( or Nilosyrtis ) is a region just north of Syrtis Major Planum on Mars , at approximately 23 ° N , 76 ° E and an elevation of  0.5 km. It marks a region of transition ( a `` crustal dichotomy '' ) between southern highland and northern lowland terrain , and consists of isolated peaks and mesas . On average , the drop in elevation between the two terrains is 5,500 meters ( 18,000 feet ) . Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) was an American robotic spacecraft developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched November 1996. ""Mars Global Surveyor"" was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet, from the ionosphere down through the atmosphere to the surface. As part of the larger Mars Exploration Program, ""Mars Global Surveyor"" performed monitoring relay for sister orbiters during aerobraking, and it helped Mars rovers and lander missions by identifying potential landing sites and relaying surface telemetry. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the ""Red Planet"" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth."

The Mazarinettes were brought to France from Italy in 1647 and 1653 to secure advantageous marriages with powerful and influential French and Italian princes. To overcome aristocratic resistance, Cardinal Mazarin generously granted large dowries to the fiancés.

Anna Maria (Marie) Mancini, born on August 28, 1639, and died on May 8, 1715, was one of the five Mancini sisters and the third of the Mazarinettes. Along with two of her female Martinozzi cousins, the Mancini sisters were known at the French court as the Mazarinettes.

Jules Raymond Mazarin, born on July 14, 1602, and died on March 9, 1661, was an Italian cardinal, diplomat, and politician who served as the Chief Minister to the King of France from 1642 until his death. He was responsible for bringing the Mazarinettes to France and arranging their advantageous marriages.

Antoine Baudeau, born around 1630, was a secretary to Marie Mancini and published a Grand Dictionnaire des Prétieuses in 1660 and a comedy, Le Procez des prétieuses, in the same year.

A chief minister is the elected head of government of a sub-national entity, such as a province, state, territory, or autonomous region. Examples include the Chief Minister of the provinces in Nepal, the Governor of the states in India, the Premier of the territories in Australia, the Chief Ministers of the provinces in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the Chief Ministers of the Philippine autonomous regions, and the Chief Ministers of British Overseas Territories that have attained self-governance. The title is also used for the heads of governments of the Malay states without a monarchy. ","An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word ""archipelago"" is derived from the Greek ""-  arkhi-"" (""chief"") and ""  pélagos"" (""sea"") through the Italian ""arcipelago"". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek ""*"" and Latin ""archipelagus"") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. Longay ( Scottish Gaelic : Longaigh is a small uninhabited Scottish island in the Inner Sound just off the coast of the Isle of Skye , north of Pabay and east of Scalpay . In 1971 , the MacBraynes mailboat Loch Seaforth ran aground on the island , sustaining only minimal damage . Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. An islet is a very small island. Types. As suggested by its origin as ""islette"", an Old French diminutive of ""isle"", use of the term implies small size, but little attention is given to drawing an upper limit on its applicability. Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. Skye, or the Isle of Skye (or ""Eilean a' Cheò""), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillins, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic ""Sgitheanach"" describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins. Pabay is a Scottish island just off the coast of the Skye. A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water."

Sydney is the second official seat and second official residence of the Governor-General of Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia and many federal ministries maintain substantial presences in Sydney. The Australian Democrats was a centrist political party in Australia with a social-liberal ideology. The party was formed in 1977, a merger of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement, with former Liberal minister Don Chipp as its high-profile leader. Though never achieving a seat in the House of Representatives, the party had considerable influence in the Senate for the following thirty years. Its representation in the Parliament of Australia ended on 30 June 2008, after loss of its four remaining Senate seats at the 2007 general election. , the organisation had disintegrated and control was contested by two factions associated with two former parliamentarians. The party was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission on 16 April 2015 due to the party's failure to demonstrate requisite 500 members to maintain registration.
Even before its deregistration and since it became extinct as a parliamentary party anywhere in Australia, the party saw many of its prominent members defect to the Greens, including former federal party leaders Janet Powell and Andrew Bartlett and former NSW MLC Arthur Chesterfield-Evans.

The car featured an updated pre-war Alvis 12/70 chassis with a larger 1892 cc engine, producing 65 bhp (48 kW) and a top speed of around 74 mph (119 km/h). The car's suspension and brakes were mechanically operated, and disc wheels replaced the wires. The Alvis Fourteen, announced in November 1946, was the first car produced by Alvis cars after World War II, available until 1950 when it was replaced by the Alvis Three Litre. ","A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. Bleuette Bernon was a French film actress who appeared in five films made by Georges Méliès around the turn of the 20th century . The earliest films , made before 1900 , were usually without plot and had a runtime of just a few minutes . However , Méliès evolved the genre of the fictional motion picture , and Bernon became one of the earliest character actors in movies . In 1899 , she played the title character in Méliès 's Jeanne d'Arc , and Cinderella in Cendrillon . In 1901 , she appeared in Barbe - bleue . In 1902 she appeared in a minor role in A Trip to the Moon , which is the best known film of Méliès , as one `` lady in the Moon '' . In 1903 she appeared as Aurora in Le Royaume des fées . Around the Moon (1870), Jules Verne's sequel to ""From the Earth to the Moon"", is a science fiction novel which continues the trip to the moon which was only partially described in the previous novel. It was later combined with ""From the Earth to the Moon"" to create ""A Trip to the Moon and Around It"". Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper, is a folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression/triumphant reward. Thousands of variants are known throughout the world. The title character is a young woman living in unfortunate circumstances, that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune. The oldest documented version comes from China, and the oldest European version from Italy. The most popular version was first published by Charles Perrault in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" in 1697, and later by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection ""Grimms' Fairy Tales"". Histoires ou contes du temps passé or Les Contes de ma Mère l'Oye (Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals or Mother Goose Tales) is a collection of literary fairy tales written by Charles Perrault, published in Paris in 1697. The work became popular because it was written at a time when fairy tales were fashionable amongst aristocrats in Parisian literary salons. Perrault wrote the work when he retired from court as secretary to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, minister to Louis XIV of France. Colbert's death may have forced Perrault's retirement, at which point he turned to writing. Scholars have debated as the origin of his tales and whether they are original literary fairy tales modified from commonly known stories, or based on stories written by earlier medieval writers such as Boccaccio. Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete. A Trip to the Moon is a 1902 French silent film directed by Georges Méliès. Inspired by a wide variety of sources, including Jules Verne's novels ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Around the Moon"", the film follows a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a cannon-propelled capsule, explore the Moon's surface, escape from an underground group of Selenites (lunar inhabitants), and return to Earth with a captive Selenite. It features an ensemble cast of French theatrical performers, led by Méliès himself in the main role of Professor Barbenfouillis, and is filmed in the overtly theatrical style for which Méliès became famous. Marie-Georges-Jean Méliès, known as Georges Méliès (8 December 1861  21 January 1938), was a French illusionist and film director who led many technical and narrative developments in the earliest days of cinema. Méliès was an especially prolific innovator in the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color. He was also the first filmmaker to use storyboards. His films include ""A Trip to the Moon"" (1902) and ""The Impossible Voyage"" (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films, though their approach is closer to fantasy. The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.  From the Earth to the Moon is an 1865 novel by Jules Verne. It tells the story of the Baltimore Gun Club, a post-American Civil War society of weapons enthusiasts, and their attempts to build an enormous Columbiad space gun and launch three peoplethe Gun Club's president, his Philadelphian armor-making rival, and a French poetin a projectile with the goal of a moon landing."

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a biopolymer composed of nucleotides, which are made up of a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA was determined through X-ray diffraction studies conducted by Rosalind Franklin, who passed away before the Nobel Prize was awarded.

Francis Crick and James Watson, both British scientists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. They proposed the double helix model, which explained how DNA stores and transmits genetic information. Their discovery has had a profound impact on medicine, as it has allowed scientists to understand the genetic basis of diseases and develop targeted treatments.

Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer, made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on DNA was crucial in the discovery of the double helix structure, but she was not recognized with a Nobel Prize due to her untimely death in 1958.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. The prize is administered by the Nobel Foundation, which was established in 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The prize is presented to the recipients on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

In conclusion, the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson, Crick, and Franklin has revolutionized the field of medicine and biology. Their work has paved the way for advancements in genetic research, disease diagnosis, and treatment. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has recognized their contributions, highlighting the importance of scientific discoveries in improving human health and well-being. ","The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.  The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it. Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches, mosques and other significant buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture.
Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term ""stained glass"" to include domestic leadlight and objets d'art created from came glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany.

Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around  43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market. A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).  Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. An altar is any structure upon which offerings such as sacrifices are made for religious purposes, and by extension the 'Holy table' of post-reformation Anglican churches. Altars are usually found at shrines, and they can be located in temples, churches and other places of worship. Today they are used particularly in Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Shinto, Taoism, as well as in Neopaganism and Ceremonial Magic. Judaism used such a structure until the destruction of the Second Temple. Many historical faiths also made use of them, including Greek and Norse religion. In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. The Notting Hill Carnival is an annual event that has taken place since 1966 on the streets of Notting Hill, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England, each August over two days (the August bank holiday Monday and the preceding Sunday).

In 2006, the UK public voted it onto the list of icons of England. Despite its name, it is not part of the global Carnival season preceding Lent. A sanctuary, in its original meaning, is a sacred place, such as a shrine. By the use of such places as a haven, by extension the term has come to be used for any place of safety.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. The ambulatory ( ""walking place"") is the covered passage around a cloister or the processional way around the east end of a cathedral or large church and behind the high altar.

It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.  The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion.

The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. In church architecture, the chancel is the space around the altar, including the choir and the sanctuary (sometimes called the presbytery), at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building. It may terminate in an apse. It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship, while the congregation is in the nave. This is one definition, sometimes called the ""strict"" one; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels, these are also often counted as part of the chancel, especially when discussing architecture. In smaller churches, where the altar is backed by the outside east wall, and there is no distinct choir, the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area. In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar, this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel.

Church architecture refers to the architecture of buildings of Christian churches. It has evolved over the two thousand years of the Christian religion, partly by innovation and partly by imitating other architectural styles as well as responding to changing beliefs, practices and local traditions. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant objects of transformation for [Christian architecture and design were the great churches of Byzantium, the Romanesque abbey churches, Gothic cathedrals and Renaissance basilicas with its emphasis on harmony. These large, often ornate and architecturally prestigious buildings were dominant features of the towns and countryside in which they stood. However, far more numerous were the parish churches in Christendom, the focus of Christian devotion in every town and village. While a few are counted as sublime works of architecture to equal the great cathedrals, the majority developed along simpler lines, showing great regional diversity and often demonstrating local vernacular technology and decoration. The nave is the central aisle of a basilica church, or the main body of a church (whether aisled or not) between its western wall and its chancel. It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity. Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.

Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

The lake is divided among four countries  Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, and Zambia, with Tanzania (46%) and DRC (40%) possessing the majority of the lake. The water flows into the Congo River system and ultimately into the Atlantic Ocean. Burundi (or ), officially the Republic of Burundi ( or ), is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of East Africa, bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. It is also considered part of Central Africa. Burundi's capital is Bujumbura. The southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika. A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World). The Hutu , also known as the Abahutu, are a population inhabiting the African Great Lakes region. They mainly live in Rwanda, Burundi, and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they form one of the principal population divisions alongside the Tutsi and the Twa. Rwanda (or ), officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a sovereign state in central and east Africa and one of the smallest countries on the African mainland. Located a few degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rwanda is in the African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated; its geography is dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. The Tutsi, or Abatutsi, are a population inhabiting the African Great Lakes region. Historically, they were often referred to as the Watutsi, Watusi, Wahuma or the Wahima. The Tutsi form a subgroup of the Banyarwanda and the Barundi peoples, who reside primarily in Rwanda and Burundi, but with significant populations also found in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. They speak Rwanda-Rundi, a group of Bantu languages. Melchior Ndadaye ( March 28 , 1953 -- October 21 , 1993 ) was a Burundian intellectual and politician . He was the first democratically elected and first Hutu president of Burundi after winning the landmark 1993 election . Though he moved to attempt to smooth the country 's bitter ethnic divide , his reforms antagonised soldiers in the Tutsi - dominated army , and he was assassinated amidst a failed military coup in October 1993 , after only three months in office . His assassination sparked an array of brutal tit - for - tat massacres between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups , and ultimately sparked the decade - long Burundi Civil War . Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa.

Set in the years following the Great Depression in Lorain, Ohio, the story centers on a young African American girl named Pecola who is taunted for her dark skin color. Pecola's desire for blue eyes stems from her belief that they would make her beautiful and loved. The novel explores themes of racism, incest, and child molestation, and has been banned from schools and libraries due to its controversial content.

Morrison, a Professor Emeritus at Princeton University, is known for her epic themes, vivid dialogue, and richly detailed characters. Her other notable works include ""Sula,"" ""Song of Solomon,"" and ""Beloved.""

In ""Love,"" Morrison tells the story of Bill Cosey, a charismatic hotel owner who dies in the 1930s. The novel follows the lives of his granddaughter, Christine, and his widow, Heed, who are sworn enemies but share his mansion. The story is told through a split narrative, jumping back and forth between different time periods. The characters in the novel all have some connection to Bill Cosey, and Morrison introduces a character named Junior, who serves as a medium to connect the dead Bill Cosey to the world of the living.

Overall, ""The Bluest Eye"" and ""Love"" are examples of Morrison's non-linear storytelling techniques and her exploration of complex themes such as love, racism, and the human experience. ","Craig Morgan Greer (born July 17, 1964), known professionally as Craig Morgan, is an American country music artist. A veteran of the United States Army as a forward observer, Morgan began his musical career in 2000 on Atlantic Records, releasing his self-titled debut album for that label before the closure of its Nashville division in 2000. In 2002, Morgan signed to the independent Broken Bow Records, on which he released three studio albums: 2003's ""I Love It"", 2005's ""My Kind of Livin'"", and 2006's ""Little Bit of Life"". These produced several chart hits, including ""That's What I Love About Sunday,"" which spent four weeks at the top of the ""Billboard"" country charts and was that publication's Number One country hit of 2005. A greatest hits package followed in mid-2008 before Morgan left the label for BNA Records, on which he released ""That's Why"" later that same year. ""My Kind of Livin"" is also his highest-selling album, having been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After exiting BNA, Morgan signed with Black River Entertainment and released ""This Ole Boy"" in 2012.

The RIAA headquarters is in Washington, D.C. Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term ""country music"" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term ""hillbilly music""; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term ""country music"" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. BNA Records, formerly known as BNA Entertainment, was a label group that shared ties with Arista Nashville and RCA Nashville from parent company Sony Music Nashville, which itself is a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment.

","The River Liffey (Irish: ""An Life"") is a river in Ireland, which flows through the centre of Dublin. Its major tributaries include the River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac. The river supplies much of Dublin's water and a range of recreational opportunities. The Irish Confederate Wars, also called the Eleven Years' War (derived from the Irish language name ""Cogadh na hAon Bhliana Déag""), took place in Ireland between 1641 and 1653. It was the Irish theatre of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms  a series of civil wars in the kingdoms of Ireland, England and Scotland (all ruled by Charles I). The conflict in Ireland essentially started by pitting the native Irish Catholics against English and Scottish Protestant colonists and their supporters, and ended with Royalists, Irish Catholics and Scottish Presbyterians fighting the ultimate winners, the English Parliament. It was both a religious and an ethnic conflict  fought over who would govern Ireland, whether it would be governed from England, which ethnic and religious group would own most of the land, and which religion would predominate in the country. It was the most destructive conflict in Irish history. Rathmines is an inner suburb on the southside of Dublin, about 3 kilometres south of the city centre. It effectively begins at the south side of the Grand Canal and stretches along the Rathmines Road as far as Rathgar to the south, Ranelagh to the east and Harold's Cross to the west. It is situated in the city's D6 postal district. The New Model Army of England was formed in 1645 by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War, and was disbanded in 1660 after the Restoration. It differed from other armies in the series of civil wars referred to as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in that it was intended as an army liable for service anywhere in the country (including in Scotland and Ireland), rather than being tied to a single area or garrison. Its soldiers became full-time professionals, rather than part-time militia. To establish a professional officer corps, the army's leaders were prohibited from having seats in either the House of Lords or House of Commons. This was to encourage their separation from the political or religious factions among the Parliamentarians. Leinster (  ) is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the east of Ireland. It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or Cromwellian war in Ireland (164953) refers to the conquest of Ireland by the forces of the English Parliament, led by Oliver Cromwell, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Cromwell invaded Ireland with his New Model Army on behalf of England's Rump Parliament in August 1649. The Wars of the Three Kingdoms, sometimes known as the British Civil Wars, formed an intertwined series of conflicts that took place in England, Ireland and Scotland between 1639 and 1651. The English Civil War proper has become the best-known of these conflicts and included the execution of the kingdoms' monarch, Charles I, by the English parliament in 1649. Oliver Cromwell (25 April 15993 September 1658) was an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Baggot Street ( Irish : Sráid Bhagóid ) is a street in Dublin , Ireland . It is named after Baggotrath , the manor granted to Robert Bagod in the 13th century . He built Baggotrath Castle , which was partly destroyed during the Battle of Rathmines and demolished in the early nineteenth century.The street was called Baggot Street in 1773 . The Battle of Rathmines was fought in and around what is now the Dublin suburb of Rathmines in August 1649, during the Irish Confederate Wars, the Irish theatre of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. It was fought between an English Parliamentarian army under Michael Jones which held Dublin and an army composed of Irish Confederate and English Royalist troops under the command of the Earl of Ormonde. The battle ended in the rout of the Confederate /Royalist army and facilitated the landing in Ireland of Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army several days later, who in the next four years completed the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Dublin is in the province of Leinster on Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey. The city has an urban area population of 1,345,402. The population of the Greater Dublin Area, , was 1,904,806 people. The Greater Dublin Area (GDA) (Irish: ""Mórcheantar Bhaile Átha Cliath""), or simply Greater Dublin is the city of Dublin and its hinterland, with varying definitions as to its extent. The National Transport Authority has defined the Greater Dublin Area as including the counties of Dublin (Dublin City, South Dublin, Dún LaoghaireRathdown and Fingal), Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow. However, this area does not comprise a formal political unit. The term can also apply more narrowly to the Dublin urban area and nearby suburban towns. The general area is sometimes referred to colloquially as The Pale."

It originated in Europe and involved more than 70 million military personnel, resulting in over nine million combatant and seven million civilian deaths. The war was characterized by technological and industrial advancements, as well as trench warfare, which led to a high casualty rate.

The Sudetenland, a region in Czechoslovakia inhabited primarily by ethnic Germans, was annexed by Nazi Germany through the Munich Agreement in 1938. This agreement, signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, allowed for the annexation of the Sudetenland and is widely regarded as a failed act of appeasement toward Germany.

The Sudetenland was home to the football club NSTG Aussig, which played in the Gauliga Sudetenland during World War II. The region's strategic importance to Czechoslovakia was significant, as it housed border defenses, banks, and heavy industrial districts.

After the war, Czechoslovakia was formed as a sovereign state in Central Europe, comprising the historical Czech lands of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. Moravia, a historical country in the Czech Republic, was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown and later an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire. It was also a crown land of the Austrian Empire and briefly a crown land of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

The Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe, covering an area of and having a population of 10.5 million.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves Jr. (17 August 1896  13 July 1970) was a United States Army Corps of Engineers officer who oversaw the construction of the Pentagon and directed the Manhattan Project, a top secret research project that developed the atomic bomb during World War II. As the son of a United States Army chaplain, Groves lived at a number of Army posts during his childhood. He graduated fourth in his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1918 and was commissioned into the US Army Corps of Engineers. In 1929, he went to Nicaragua as part of an expedition whose purpose was to conduct a survey for the Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal. Following the 1931 Nicaragua earthquake, Groves took over responsibility for Managua's water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. He attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1935 and 1936, and the Army War College in 1938 and 1939, after which he was posted to the War Department General Staff. The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District; ""Manhattan"" gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $2 billion (about $ in 2017 dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and producing the fissile materials, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and the city's historical birthplace. The borough is coextensive with New York County, founded on November 1, 1683, as one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the East, Hudson, and Harlem rivers, and also includes several small adjacent islands and Marble Hill, a small neighborhood on the U.S. mainland. The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR "" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. Julius Robert Oppenheimer (April 22, 1904  February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. As the wartime head of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Oppenheimer is among those who are called the ""father of the atomic bomb"" for their role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II project that developed the first nuclear weapons used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity test in New Mexico; Oppenheimer remarked later that it brought to mind words from the ""Bhagavad Gita"": ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" Cheka (    ""chrezvychaynaya komissiya"", Emergency Committee) was the first of a succession of Soviet state security organizations. It was created on December 20, 1917, after a decree issued by Vladimir Lenin, and was subsequently led by Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat turned communist. By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had been created in various cities, at multiple levels including: oblast, guberniya (""Gubcheks""), raion, uyezd, and volost Chekas, with Raion and Volost Extraordinary Commissioners. After 1922, Cheka groups underwent a series of reorganizations, with the NKVD, into bodies whose members continued to be referred to as ""Chekisty"" (Chekists) into the late 1980s. Bruno Pontecorvo (""Bruno Maksimovich Pontecorvo""; 22 August 1913  24 September 1993) was an Italian nuclear physicist, an early assistant of Enrico Fermi and the author of numerous studies in high energy physics, especially on neutrinos. A convinced communist, he defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, where he continued his research on the decay of the muon and on neutrinos. The prestigious Pontecorvo Prize was instituted in his memory in 1995. The Republics of the Soviet Union or the Union Republics (""soyuznye respubliki"") of the Soviet Union were ethnically based administrative units that were subordinated directly to the Government of the Soviet Union. For most of its history, the Soviet Union was a highly centralized state; the decentralization reforms during the era of ""Perestroika"" (""Restructuring"") and ""Glasnost"" (""Openness"") conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Induced radioactivity occurs when a previously stable material has been made radioactive by exposure to specific radiation. Most radioactivity does not induce other material to become radioactive. This Induced radioactivity was discovered by Irène Curie and F. Joliot in 1934 and received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for this discovery. This is also known as man-made radioactivity. The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive by artificial or induced methods is called artificial radioactivity. The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Emil Julius Klaus Fuchs (29 December 1911  28 January 1988) was a German theoretical physicist and atomic spy who, in 1950, was convicted of supplying information from the American, British, and Canadian Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union during and shortly after the Second World War. While at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fuchs was responsible for many significant theoretical calculations relating to the first nuclear weapons, and later, early models of the hydrogen bomb. World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of ""total war"", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world. Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), when it achieved criticality, became the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Its construction was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It was built by the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi, who described the apparatus as ""a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers"". The KGB, an initialism for ""Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti"" (translated in English as Committee for State Security), was the main security agency for the Soviet Union from 1954 until its break-up in 1991. Formed in 1954, as a direct successor of such preceding agencies as the Cheka, NKGB, and MGB, the committee was attached to the Council of Ministers. It was the chief government agency of ""union-republican jurisdiction"", acting as internal security, intelligence, and secret police. Similar agencies were constituted in each of the republics of the Soviet Union aside from Russia and consisted of many ministries, state committees, and state commissions. The muon (from the Greek letter mu () used to represent it) is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with an electric charge of 1 ""e"" and a spin of, but with a much greater mass. It is classified as a lepton. As is the case with other leptons, the muon is not believed to have any sub-structurethat is, it is not thought to be composed of any simpler particles. Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901  28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the ""architect of the nuclear age"" and the ""architect of the atomic bomb"". He was one of the few physicists to excel both theoretically and experimentally. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics. Lev Vasilevsky , also known as Leonid A. Tarasov , was the KGB Mexico City Illegal Resident during much of the period of the Manhattan Project . In 1943 , Moscow Center of KGB intelligence activities in North America , decided all contacts with J. Robert Oppenheimer , scientific director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos laboratory , would be through ' illegals ' only . Vasilevsky operating from Mexico City was put in charge of running the illegal network after New York Resident Vasily Zarubin had been recalled to Moscow . Vasilevsky instructions were to control the network from the Mexico City Residentura . Bruno Pontecorvo was the conduit supplying the atomic secrets from Enrico Fermi . Vasilevsky provided Pontecorvo with an escape route through Finland which Pontecorvo used in 1950 after the arrest of Klaus Fuchs . Kitty Harris went to Mexico City in early 1943 to be a courier for Vasilevsky . She was further detailed by Vasilevsky to the Santa Fe drugstore safe house where she coordinated the front 's clandestine activities . In 1945 , for his work in handling the Fermi line in the United States , Vasilevsky was appointed deputy director of Department S. For a short period in 1947 he was the director of the department of scientific and technological intelligence in the Committee of Information ( KI ) . In November 1945 , when the Soviet atomic bomb project was having difficulty starting its first nuclear reactor . Yakov Terletsky of the Soviet project and Vasilevsky travelled to Denmark to seek the advice of Niels Bohr , another veteran of the World War II Manhattan project . New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research. Today there are about 450 nuclear power reactors that are used to generate electricity in about 30 countries around the world. The Bhagavad Gita ("""" in IAST, ; lit. ""Song of the Lord""), often referred to as 
simply the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic ""Mahabharata"" (chapters 25 - 42 of the 6th book of Mahabharata)."

New jack swing or swingbeat is a fusion genre spearheaded by Teddy Riley and Bernard Belle that became popular from the late 1980s into the early 1990s. Its influence, along with hip hop, seeped into pop culture and was the definitive sound of the inventive black New York club scene. It fuses the rhythms, samples, and production techniques of hip hop and dance-pop with the urban contemporary sound of R&B. The new jack swing style developed as many previous music styles did, by combining elements of older styles with newer sensibilities. It used R&B style vocals sung over hip hop and dance-pop style influenced instrumentation. The sound of new jack swing comes from the hip hop ""swing"" beats created by drum machine, and hardware samplers, which was popular during the Golden Age of Hip Hop, with contemporary R&B style singing.

The borrower or debtor may be a sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. The lender or creditor may be a bank, credit card company, payday loan provider, or an individual. Debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest. The term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value. For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a ""debt of gratitude"" to the second person.

A stock exchange or bourse is an exchange where stock brokers and traders can buy and/or sell stocks (also called shares), bonds, and other securities. Stock exchanges may also provide facilities for issue and redemption of securities and other financial instruments, and capital events including the payment of income and dividends. Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. Stock exchanges often function as ""continuous auction"" markets, with buyers and sellers consummating transactions at a central location, such as the floor of the exchange. In accounting, equity (or owner's equity) is the difference between the value of the assets and the cost of the liabilities of something owned. It is governed by the following equation:
For example, if someone owns a car worth $15,000 (an asset), but owes $5,000 on a loan against that car (a liability), the car represents $10,000 of equity. Equity can be negative if liabilities exceeds assets. Shareholders' equity (or stockholders' equity, shareholders' funds, shareholders' capital or similar terms) represents the equity of a company as divided among shareholders of common or preferred stock. Negative shareholders' equity is often referred to as a shareholders' deficit. An asset class is a group of instruments which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets. Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true. For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the underlying instrument but are subject to different regulations than the underlying instrument.

IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), also known as Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the Earth's magnetosphere's response to changes in the solar wind. Launched on March 25, 2000, by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB, the mission ended in December 2005. ","Alfonso of León , Lord of Molina ( 1202 -- 6 January 1272 ) was an infante ( prince ) of León and Castile , the son of King Alfonso IX of León and his second wife Queen Berengaria of Castile . He was the brother of King Ferdinand III of Castile and León , and father of Queen Maria of Molina , wife of King Sancho IV. He became Lord of Molina and Mesa after his first marriage to Mafalda González de Lara , the heiress of those lands . Alfonso IX (15 August 1171  23 or 24 September 1230) was king of León and Galicia from the death of his father Ferdinand II in 1188 until his own death. According to Ibn Khaldun (13321406), he is said to have been called the ""Baboso"" or ""Slobberer"" because he was subject to fits of rage during which he foamed at the mouth. A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a ""Raja Isteri"" with prefix ""Pengiran Anak"", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. The Holy Roman Emperor (historically """" ""Emperor of the Romans"") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (""imperator electus"") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title. Spanish nobles are persons who possess the legal status of hereditary nobility according to the laws and traditions of the Spanish monarchy. A system of titles and honours of Spain and of the former kingdoms that constitute it comprise the Spanish nobility. Some nobles possess various titles that may be inherited, but the creation and recognition of titles is legally a prerogative of the King of Spain. Berengaria (Castilian: ""Berenguela""; 1179 or 1180  8 November 1246) was queen regnant of Castile in 1217 and queen consort of León from 1197 to 1204. As the eldest child and heir presumptive of Alfonso VIII of Castile, she was a sought after bride, and was engaged to Conrad, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. After his death, she married her cousin, Alfonso IX of León, to secure the peace between him and her father. She had five children with him before their marriage was voided by Pope Innocent III. Infante (; f. infanta), also anglicised as Infant or translated as Prince, is the title and rank given in the Iberian kingdoms of Spain (including the predecessor kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Navarre and León), and Portugal, to the sons and daughters (""infantas"") of the king, sometimes with the exception of the heir apparent to the throne who usually bears a unique princely or ducal title. The wife of an ""infante"" was accorded the title of ""infanta"" if the marriage was dynastically approved (e.g. Princess Alicia of Bourbon-Parma), although since 1987 this is no longer automatically the case in Spain (e.g. Princess Anne d'Orléans). Husbands of born ""infantas"" did not obtain the title of ""infante"" through marriage (unlike most hereditary titles of Spanish nobility), although occasionally elevated to that title ""de gracia"" (""by grace"") at the sovereign's command. Ibn Khaldun (; 27 May 1332  19 March 1406) was a North African Arab historiographer and historian.
He is claimed as a forerunner of the modern disciplines of sociology and demography."

The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. The Ozarks are also home to the tallgrass prairie, an ecosystem native to central North America. The Mississippi River, the largest river in North America, flows through the state of Missouri, which achieved statehood in 1821. Missouri is the eighteenth most populous state in the U.S., with over six million residents. The state is geographically diverse, with the Northern Plains, the Ozarks, and the Mississippi River Delta. The state's capital is Jefferson City, and its largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River. Judith K. Moriarty, the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State, was removed from office in 1994 following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives. The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state, extending south of 36°30 north latitude. The largest city in the region is Kennett. ","Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as ""Republic of the Equator""), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland. The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Iquitos, also known as Iquitos City, is the capital city of Peru's Maynas Province and Loreto Region. The largest metropolis in the Peruvian Amazon, east of the Andes, it is the sixth most populous city of Peru.  Loreto is Peru's northernmost region. Covering almost one-third of Peru's territory, Loreto is by far the nation's largest region; it is also one of the most sparsely populated regions due to its remote location in the Amazon Rainforest. Its capital is Iquitos. The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the ""Old World"" from the ""New World"". Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. Mismi is a mountain peak of volcanic origin located in the Ch'ila mountain range in the Andes of Peru. A glacial stream on the Mismi was firmly identified as the most distant source of the Amazon River in 1996; this finding was confirmed in 2001 and again in 2007.
The waters from Mismi flow into the streams Qarwasanta and Apachita, which flow into the Apurímac River. It is a tributary of the Ucayali which later joins the Marañón to form the Amazon proper. Solimões is the name often given to upper stretches of the Amazon River in Brazil from its confluence with the Rio Negro upstream to the border of Peru. The Solimões portion of the Amazon river lies entirely in the State of Amazonas, Brazil, and some portion of the state is often referred to as the ""Solimões region"". The ecoregion of the Solimões river drainage basin is entirely tropical rainforest. The Apurímac River (; from Quechua ""apu"" 'divinity' and ""rimaq"" 'oracle, talker') rises from glacial meltwater of the ridge of the Mismi, a mountain in the Arequipa Province in southern Peru. Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. The Mantaro River is a long river running through the central region of Peru. Its Quechua name means ""great river"". The word ""Mantaro"" may be a word originally from the Ashaninka language, who live downstream along the Ene River. The Mantaro, along with the Apurimac River, holds the distinction of being the source of the Amazon River, depending on the criteria used for definition. The Marañón River is the principal or mainstem source of the Amazon River, arising about 160 km to the northeast of Lima, Peru, and flowing through a deeply eroded Andean valley in a northwesterly direction, along the eastern base of the Cordillera of the Andes, as far as 5 degrees 36' southern latitude; from where it makes a great bend to the northeast, and cuts through the jungle Andes, until at the Pongo de Manseriche it flows into the flat Amazon basin. Although historically, the term ""Marañon River"" often was applied to the river all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, nowadays the Marañon River is generally thought to end at the confluence with the Ucayali River, after which most cartographers label the ensuing waterway the Amazon River. Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as ""Amérique latine"" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. The Peruvian Amazon is the area of the Amazon rainforest included within the country of Peru, from east of the Andes to the borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia. This region comprises 60% of the country and is marked by a large degree of biodiversity. Peru has the second-largest portion of the Amazon rainforest after the Brazilian Amazon. South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). The Pongo de Manseriche is a gorge in northwest Peru. The Marañón River runs through this gorge (and water gap) before it reaches the Amazon Basin. The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. Lima (Spanish: , Quechua: , Aymara: ) is the capital and the largest city of Peru. It is located in the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and Lurín rivers, in the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Together with the seaport of Callao, it forms a contiguous urban area known as the Lima Metropolitan Area. With a population of almost 10 million, Lima is the most populous metropolitan area of Peru and the second-largest city in the Americas (as defined by ""city proper""), behind São Paulo and before Mexico City. The Meeting of Waters is the confluence between the dark (blackwater) Rio Negro and the pale sandy-colored (whitewater) Amazon River or Rio Solimões, as the upper section of the Amazon is known in Brazil upriver of this confluence. For the two rivers' waters run side by side without mixing. It is one of the main tourist attractions of Manaus, Brazil. The same also happens near Santarém, Pará with the Amazon and Tapajós rivers. This phenomenon occurs in other regions of the world with differing characters of rivers. Manaus or Manaós before 1939 or (formerly) Barra do Rio Negro, is the capital city of the state of Amazonas in the North Region of Brazil. It is situated at the confluence of the Negro and Solimões rivers. With a population of more than 2 million, it is the most populous city of both the Brazilian state of Amazonas and the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon River (or ; Spanish and ) in South America is the largest river by discharge of water in the world, and according to some experts, the longest in length.
The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazons most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the Mantaro River in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac confluence, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn confluences with the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters at Manaus, the river's largest city. Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the ""New World"".  Sarameriza is a small fluvial port in the department of Loreto . Its place is strategic since it is immediately after the Pongo de Manseriche and therefore it is the first navigable point on the Marañón River on the way to the Amazon River and therefore the city of Iquitos and the border with Brazil . It is located at : 4 ° 33 ' 58.34 `` S , 77 ° 25 ' 0.98 '' W , according to Google Earth . The Ucayali River arises about north of Lake Titicaca, in the Arequipa region of Peru. The Amazon River takes its name close to Nauta city (100 km upstream/south of Iquitos), at the confluence of the Marañón and Ucayali rivers. The Ucayali becomes a major tributary of the Amazon River. Navigation was blocked by lengthy sections of rapids. The city of Pucallpa is located on the banks of the Ucayali."
