He started his career with Burnley Belvedere before joining Football League side Burnley in 1902.  Over the next seven years, Bell made 101 league appearances and scored 28 goals for the Lancashire club.  During his career, he won three caps for the England national amateur football team.  An architect by trade, Bell also played as an amateur cricketer for Burnley Cricket Club for 20 years, during which time he won five Lancashire League championships.  He was selected to represent the Lancashire Second XI on three occasions.
