Wu, also known as Eastern Wu, was founded by Sun Quan in 222 and declared independence from the Cao Wei state in 229. Sun Quan ruled as &quot;King of Wu&quot; until 229 and as &quot;Emperor of Wu&quot; until 252. The state\\&#x27;s capital was initially Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu) but later moved to Wuchang (present-day Ezhou, Hubei). The state of Cao Wei was established by Cao Pi in 220, with its capital at Luoyang. Cao Wei\\&#x27;s authority weakened after the death of Cao Rui, leading to the rise of Sima Yi and his family. The state of Shu Han was founded by Liu Bei in 221, with its capital at Chengdu. The Yellow Turban Rebellion (184-205) marked a significant event in Taoism\\&#x27;s history due to its association with secret Taoist societies. Japan, located off the eastern coast of Asia, is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean. The Qin dynasty (221206 BC) was the first unified Chinese empire, founded by Qin Shi Huang after conquering the other states during the Warring States period. The Warring States period (481403 BC) was a time of conflict that ended with the Qin dynasty\\&#x27;s victory in 221 BC. Archimedes of Syracuse was a renowned mathematician and scientist. The concept of buoyancy, or Archimedes\\&#x27; principle, states that the upward force exerted on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The state of Cao Wei was founded by Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power during the late Eastern Han dynasty. Cao Cao\\&#x27;s son, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate in his favor, establishing the Cao Wei state.
